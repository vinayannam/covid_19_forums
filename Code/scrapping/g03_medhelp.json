        "author": "/personal_pages/user/20906447",
        "content": "both of the following statements are on the cdc website on pages updated within the past week and a half: 1: covid-19 cases are extremely high. avoid events and gatherings. covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are extremely high across the united states. to decrease your chance of getting and spreading covid-19, cdc recommends that you do not gather with people who do not live with you at this time. attending events and gatherings increases your risk of getting and spreading covid-19. stay home to protect yourself and others from covid-19. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) 2: evidence suggests that many k-12 schools that have strictly implemented mitigation strategies have been able to safely open for in-person instruction and remain open. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html) well which is it? i don't understand why, given certain criteria and and mitigation strategies are satisfied, it is supposed be safe to send my younger child into a public classroom most of the day, every day, yet it is absolutely not safe to see my other child who just left home shortly before the pandemic, even rigorously using all the same mitigation strategies, and with community spread being equal. it just doesn't seem to add up. to better frame my question, first consider my family still at home: either my wife or i (not both) buys groceries once a week, at the time we believe is the least busy hour of the week. we carefully select and always use ppe based on the best information available. my son is in virtual school, and i work from home, except for rare occasions where it is necessary to go to work to perform my job, and then i follow strict social distancing and all the recommended covid ppe and safety guidelines. we do get curbside pickup or go through the drive through a couple times a week. otherwise, we never leave the house except for walks where we will not even be likely to encounter other pedestrians, or for essential doctor visits, or oddball one-off situations, like when we had to have a tire repair. unfortunately this is against a backdrop of covid-19 not being taken seriously in the surrounding community, with many acting as though there were no pandemic. of course our strategies do really minimize encountering such people, but we can't reduce it to zero. now, i don't have a good feel as to whether we have reduced our risk 70%, 90%, 98%, or even to near zero compared to someone who does not take covid-19 seriously. do the experts have a good idea to what the risk would be to people with our lifestyle, or are we still at a point where there is still not enough research or information so that anyone really knows the answer to that question? if there is a good, evidence based estimate on how much the risk is reduced for a family like ours, what would that be? and what is really the risk seeing family members you do not live with, given masks, social distancing, and other guidelines are adhered to? my personal prediction would be that it is less risky than buying groceries, but i would trust evidence that can be defended much more than my gut, and it really bothers me that an organization which is supposed to represent the gold standard for dispensing evidence based guidance makes both of those statements above without offering compelling justification as to why they should both be true.",

                "content": "you are saying the cdc says to stay home from events and gatherings (notably, holiday gatherings) to reduce risk, yet also says schools that have \"strictly implemented mitigation strategies\" have been able to safely open and remain open, and you find this contradictory? i've seen a rundown of some of the strict mitigation strategies our school district is going to use. all kids get their temps taken on entry to the building, every day. the kids and teachers are masked all day. the staff sprays the desks between classes. they seat the kids spaced out more than 6 feet. and they are going to send the kids home for lunch every day, rather than have them eat together in a lunchroom. this doesn't remotely look like thanksgiving at uncle bob and aunt jenna's house. holiday gatherings involve an affectionate group who wants to be close to each other. there are hugs, laughter, loud talking and shouting, eating sitting next to each other, and drinking and the let-down of restraint. schools have control over their population, if they want to not create superspreader events, they implement the controls. there are no such controls at grandma's house at christmas. it doesn't seem so hard to understand, to me. i don't think there are absolute answers to the kind of questions you're asking about the exposure and the odds, not only because there are questions about how people get exposed, but also, some people are more susceptible than others to the same exposure. (a family i know has five kids. covid came, and the wife got it, and her newborn baby got it. nobody else in the family got it. figure that out when trying to put together a standard rule.) my husband and i are cautious about the virus, and don't do much that we used to do. (we order online and pick up our groceries at the store, for example -- the employees come out and load them in the back of our car.) my loving and gregarious extended family, i have no way to know what they've been doing lately, like who they've been greeting exuberantly and talking loudly with. (maybe nobody and maybe their buddy next door, who happens to have just been exposed to covid and doesn't know it.) so we're just really cautious and don't expose, and we wear our best-quality masks when out, and we in fact stay home a lot. i'm hoping that by the time our middle-schooler is back in school in person, we have our shots.",

                "content": "part of the problem is the age of your kids, which you don't state. very young children don't get covid in large numbers, though nobody knows why. older kids do, and while most are asymptomatic or have very mild cases, they are the ones along with young adults who are spreading the virus to everyone else. us older folks are mostly, at least in urban areas where most people live, and except in very trump-loving states, staying as safe as we can because we are more susceptible not just to getting covid but getting it bad. then there's the issue of underlying conditions. if you have them, you're never safe around others. then of course some of us have much better immune systems than others. i go to the grocery store. i've been to dentists. i pick up take-out at restaurants, though i don't eat at them. i always wear a mask -- now. in the beginning, we were told not to, and i still did these things. but i seldom get very sick with anything, so i'm probably not at as much risk as someone who does get sick often. when i do get sick, it's usually mild. now, i do have a ton of things wrong with me due to a medication that messed me up completely, so i have a lot of injuries and pain and other things but that's not the same thing as being susceptible to illness easily. as for school, it can be done. the problem is in the us we don't do it. ever seen a video of a south korean school? every child behind plexiglass. no eating lunch together. no playing together. i don't believe their school ever completely closed. they spent the money to provide this and enough space for social distancing and masks were already commonly worn there so no mask resistance. the problem is the us or brazil or england and other countries where for political reasons society isn't willing to cooperate or to provide the funding to redo the schools. but the problem is still that the kids can pass the virus to you even if it doesn't bother them a whole lot, and then there are the kids who have had a bad case and that is even more tragic than when a very old person gets it. at home, you can gather, but only outside and socially distanced. if you have a big enough yard you can do that. there are videos from canada of families gathering but never getting close to one another. stuff can be done but apparently not by americans. you want to fix that, you have to fix our culture and our politics, and good luck with that. so it's not so simple. just hold on a while longer and we'll get our shots, but only if enough americans agree to get vaccinated and wear masks and still what is needed to rob the virus of hosts. until then, everything will be of some risk, and yes, it can be managed, but it isn't being managed yet. if it hadn't gotten political, we'd all be better off and a whole lot of dead people wouldn't be dead. peace.",

                    "in my 67 and a half years on this earth i have never been tested for the flu, and certainly not for a cold. it's not that i have never been to a doctor for things that could have been flu, i have. the fact tests exist doesn't mean you're going to get one. as for a cold, it's such a minor illness, and we've all had so many of them, or at least we think they've been colds, that i'd be surprised if anyone but a major hypochondriac ever went to a doctor because of a cold. for most of us who are older, the same is true for the flu. i don't believe there is a test for a cold, but there i believe you can test for antibodies for having had colds. i think this because there have been reports on investigations of the immune system and some of these have found some immunity to covid and they surmise this is because of prior colds, which are a closely related corona virus. but i'm just surmising, it could be they're just guessing and don't actually have a test for cold antibodies. but my point was, if you only have the sniffles or other very mild symptoms, you aren't going to receive any treatment even if you do have covid. you will be sent home and told to drink plenty of fluids etc. because visiting a facility that does testing exposes you potentially to someone who is there with covid, most people have been avoiding their doctors, which has led to some people suffering from other illnesses they have and some have died because of this. but obviously a medical facility of any kind is the most likely place to find yourself near someone with covid. but if you need a doc, you need a doc, and as i've said, my best friend has been treated in a hospital for pancreatitis during covid and if he hadn't he'd be dead. (of course, they also removed his gall bladder that was perfectly fine and tried to give him insulin for diabetes which he didn't have and would have killed him, so going to the hospital also almost killed him). but the epidemiologists mostly say we should all get tested repeatedly so we can know how much covid is around and who has it and therefore who has to be quarantined and contact traced. which means even with no symptoms we should all be getting tested all the time, as you can get the virus ten minutes after a negative test, and most of the tests are quite inaccurate. so my answer is yeah, we should all be getting tested, but we're not going to do it because it means potentially exposing yourself to the virus unless that saliva test works better than it does now and can be done from home, if you're the kind of person who is so cautious you're not going anywhere until the vaccine arrives. but if you're getting tested because you believe you need to be treated, if you have a very mild case with such mild symptoms you won't in fact receive any treatment, and the treatments being used are only being used in hospitals because they all have some pretty bad potential side effects. it's a quandary, no?"

                    "except, nothing dentists do is actually good for you nor do they get rid of infection. the only procedure that might get rid of infection cleanly is an extraction, but even then, and quite often, while the tooth is gone, the infection isn't. you just don't notice it much. root canals lock infection inside the tooth, as only the largest canals can be cleaned out, and even then, there is often lingering infection above the gum line. filling a cavity puts toxic substances in place of a toxic substance, and the least toxic filling materials don't last that long. dentists are mostly to free us from pain, and that's a big big thing, but they really don't necessarily free us of infection or toxicity up there. plus, as you age, the amount of radiation up there just goes up. this isn't that unusual. surgeries seldom fix anything completely, either. we all do the best we can, and some just do what pays well, and some don't keep up with current knowledge, but the luckiest folks are those who just have really good teeth. i only know all this because i have really bad teeth, and so you learn. i read a very interesting article by a dentist who pointed out way better than i can just how bad for you dentistry is, and yet it's still better than the alternative, which is living the life you do have in constant pain. so i am wondering how useful the above data is, given that dental procedures don't usually find infection or fix it completely. so while we may draw a correlation between those with obvious gum disease, that doesn't count all the rest of us who have some but don't know it because our dentists didn't find it. maybe the correlation is, therefore, much weaker than reported, which is what i expect. but who knows? just to say, don't worry about it, folks, we really can't know. peace, all, and stay safe.",

(within 6 hours of learning someone had covid, for example, they would be able to locate 300 people who had been in contact with the sick person. in the u.s., if you ever got that far at all, it sure wouldn't be the same day, and in most cases there wasn't even much of an attempt.) bhutan evidently has a lot of social cohesion and relied on it, and also (not an insignificant aspect of their success) there is high trust of the government. the king was photographed in his mask early on, and pushed for a lot of the other steps they took. and, the population being largely buddhist, there is a whole lot of attitude that we must do what we can for the good of our neighbor. (as you can see, we are not talking about the united states.) bhutan is no an idyllic place -- they have a refugee crisis with people displaced originally from nepal many years ago who were never granted full civil rights, and who have been recently (and forcibly) been pushed back from bhutan to nepal, and it's been pretty ugly. but this article is about covid and why they have had only one death. if you're interested in reading it, it's in the atlantic, and i think is titled \"bhutan is the world's unlikeliest pandemic success.\"",

                    "i think you can state the tv program, if that's what it is. i was found in violation of rules for referring people generally to google something, but they do appear to allow specific links to specific websites such as mayo clinic so i can't see how that would differ from a helpful video seen on tv. of course, i don't work for medhelp but it does sound like useful stuff. i have to say, though, because of a ton of physical therapy i have to do and my inability to watch tv when i'm doing it but i can listen, i do listen to a lot of news programming, and i also listen to a lot of public radio where i hear the bbc and canadian radio, and what i've heard is the t cell theory is not at all known to be true and is also a bit of a conspiracy theory. it's a fave, for example, of the complete quack who until recently was trump's main medical advisor on covid. it might be true but there as far as i've heard no proof of it. but there is a lot of theory behind it, and is cited as a possible reason africans aren't getting covid as bad as other parts of the world as they are exposed to a very wide array of tropical diseases. doesn't explain south america, though, so there you go. as for the part of nationalizing, i don't mean this as a general rule. in this specific instance of both the pfizer and moderna vaccines, the initial research on rna was begun by the federal gov't. it wasn't started by moderna or the german company that developed the pfizer vaccine because they didn't exist yet. moderna was created by darpa, the military organization that also gave us the initial internet. the german company was, i believe, founded by scientists who also worked on rna with the us gov't. i also believe the initial reason was to deal with hiv, but in all these years not one product that worked was ever produced and yet these companies still existed to invent the covid vaccine. how was that? because they were created by gov't money and gov't research. then, after a time, they broke off, went public, got venture capital funding as well, and kept losing money every year for years until now. that makes this particular situation very different from other situations. it wouldn't apply to any other vaccine, because all the others use older technology that wasn't originally a gov't program, or at least wasn't recently a gov't program. so i'm not arguing for a public nationalized vaccine program, maybe that's a good idea but i think nationalized medicine in general is a good idea and also a problematic idea. it's great for most medicine, but not for the highest end medicine, so i can't really say about vaccines. i can only say for certain that the two vaccines that are now approved based on rna are basically us gov't programs and that makes a good case in a time of great need for nationalization, as with nationalization we can order everyone with a lab to produce it and get what we need much faster. now, this is also a bit problematic because the johnson and johnson vaccine if it works will be better for the world than the two we have now, as it uses older technology and therefore would be much less expensive to produce, ship, and get to every place in the world, and that company can produce a ton of medicine. it would therefore be much faster to get in arms. peace.",

(even in oregon with its scanty 325 deaths so far, the numbers are rising, and the governor still gets flack over any restriction. a small business that is about to go under doesn't think a firm hand with shutdowns \"good government,\" believe me.) because the money that supports politicians is not on the side of safety but instead favors business, i don't look to the government to police the airline industry further. all one can do is not fly.",

                    "one article said \"britain has pre-ordered 100 million doses of the jab - which is expected to cost just \u00a32 a time and can be stored at standard temperatures - with four million ready to be rolled out as soon as it gets regulatory approval.\" at this price they can cover the world especially if the half dose ends up proven enough that it becomes the standard. if we never find out if the first 2 prevent disease, then i would think this 70 might be popular. now that there are 3 vax, the government campaigns to get people to take it will begin to unfold depending on when countries approve it, and with rising infection rates soon to choke off hospital access to lots of people, there is intense pressure everywhere to get this reviewed asap. https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13271055/oxfords-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-pandemic/",
                    "i'm guessing especially in the us emergency approval is going to get granted, so we aren't going to wait for the normal process to play itself out. i have some concerns about that, because all of these studies are very very short term. but given the gravity of what's happening, we gotta try something. people just aren't doing what they need to do to keep the spread down, and the us is the worst. i believe the one astrazeneca would actually use is 90% effective; i don't imagine they are going to use the protocol that was only 60%. &0% was the average of the two protocols. and other vaccines are coming on line soon as well. i'm a bit confused as to why everyone is so happy there will be many vaccines. i would think it would be better to use the one that works the best and nationalize the whole thing the world over so whatever it takes to get it into people's arms happens. that would seem to be easiest with the moderna vax, as that company was created by the defense dept with taxpayer dollars, and this is the first product they've come out with. i say just nationalize the company, which would allow a mandate to produce as much as is needed the world over and also allow funding the refrigeration needed, assuming the data is sound and it does actually work as well as the press release said. but that won't happen, as we're always using taxpayer money to invent stuff and then letting private companies do whatever they want with the discoveries. alas."

(and as a result, those tests are often not accurate.) we can and do sneeze and cough out the molecules, that's why 280,000 people so far have died. but it's more practical to capture the virus molecules where there are the most but still reachable.

(and some of those mommies probably had pretty fancy insurance to allow them that fast of access to a doctor!) but it's worth knowing that tamiflu is out there. by all reports, unless one waits around to get tested until they've been sick for a few days, it does shorten the length of time that one is ill with flu (even adults), it evidently makes the sick person less contagious to others, and especially, it seems to make the person feel a lot better quickly.",

                    "i get regular covid updates from an email list i'm on from my county gov't, and they often have links to places like the cdc about the latest risks and such. as annie says, it doesn't appear asthma is a risk factor after all, but copd is. i have no idea why that is, but it is. above suggests it's inhalers, but i'm not sure how anyone would know that because i'm guessing inhaler use among asthma sufferers is pretty individual. inhalers also don't all use the same technology. being overweight isn't necessarily a risk factor but obesity appears to be one of the worst risk factors and you don't sound obese. of course, we don't know how much of you is fat and how much is muscle and the like, but while your ideal weight would be lower than that unless you were incredibly muscular like a pro football player, again, you're not obese. interestingly, the latest report i saw said that type 2 diabetes is a very high risk factor but type 1 is a low risk factor, though it does increase the risk some. perhaps this has to do with diet, as type 2 is a dietary disease while type 1 is a genetic disease, but it doesn't explain anything, it just lists the risk factors in order of risk. at bottom, there are safer ways to do this and less safe ways, and your state and your school and your country will determine how bad the risk is. if you live in the us or brazil or any other stupid country that is overrun with out of control covid, obviously the risk is higher than if you live in a country where the virus rate was pushed way down. i've also seen video on the news from south korea, i think it was, where extraordinary precautions were taken -- everyone wore masks and visors, and student desks were walled off making them into cubicles. social distancing was strictly enforced, mask wearing and visor wearing were mandatory, and students ate separated in their classrooms, not in a cafeteria or on the schoolyard. we won't do that in the us, in many states there won't really be mask requirements or social distancing, so i would think the thing for teachers to do is refuse to show up for work unless something relatively safe is mandated. don't know if that would work or they'd just find different teachers, but watching that video of south korea really impressed me. i've also thought about turning all our schools into boarding schools for the time being so students don't take the virus home to their elders. until we get a vaccine or a different approach. there do seem to be ways to do this, but it won't happen in the us generally so every teacher is going to have to work on their particular school to pressure that school into doing it in the safest way possible. so while i don't think what you've mentioned are necessarily extra risk factors, it can be done in a much better way. peace."

                    "you will never find researched information about natural medicine in the us. this is historical and based on the economic competition model the us uses for everything including health care. at the end of the 19th century, seeing a physician was still the most harmful thing you could usually do if you were sick. most people saw herbalists and homeopaths and the like. because of this, even into the 1970's american doctors were still less likely to tell you to take a drug for many things than to use tried and true gentler remedies. if you had a cough, for example, they didn't give you an antibiotic whether or not they found any infection as they do now, they sent you to buy some cough syrup based on slippery elm bark and wild cherry bark with some alcohol. it was only when things got serious they did serious medicine. but the robber barons got together and decided allopathic medicine was where the money was to be made, and that's where their money went. in the early 20th century, the fda was created, and it was all about issuing patents granting lucrative patent approvals for synthetic drugs. those early drugs were usually made from plants they already knew worked, and they are still making drugs that mimic what plants do. but they do it faster and in a much more intensive and isolated manner, so they have many more side effects but work much more quickly and probably more consistently. there's a benefit and a big cost. because patent law didn't, until recently, and this is interesting, and theoretically still can't be applied to anything that isn't materially altered from a natural state, you can't patent vitamin c or garlic. you can patent methods of making them but that doesn't really give you much of a monopoly so there simply isn't the money out there to do extensive research on plant medicine or other natural medicine. it's really expensive to do double blinded human trials, it takes years, and if you can't get a monopoly for a period of time at the end there's no pot of gold out there for you. it is what it is. that's our system, and it's why you might treat a large animal with minerals but doctors don't know how to do this with humans anymore. it won't pay their bills and buy their second homes. again, this is our system. the natural medicine system has been so demeaned publicly by these well-financed interests that it is now called \"alternative\" medicine even though it's the older form of medicine and the pharmaceutical form is so new it's actually an experiment on us as guinea pigs. but when it comes to something that kills quickly like the corona virus -- it can turn on you in a second and go from a slow mild disease to something fierce -- it's unlikely natural remedies would be of help in time. they are slow. they are mild. now, as to saunas, don't know where you're going with that. putting someone with a fever in a sauna with breathing problems might probably kill them more quickly. garlic has no anti-viral properties. it has some anti-fungal antibiotic properties, but not anti-viral. same with propolis, which is most often used with topical problems such as the gums or the skin. vitamin c has been researched a ton but didn't really pan out all that much other than what was already known, it's a powerful and necessary antioxidant that is great for long-term health but won't probably help you much if you've already gotten sick. so this was long, but the lack of info is on purpose. and with things that kill quickly, if natural medicine had been that great we'd have never looked for stronger stuff. there is a place for both forms of medicine. eating well, exercising, and making sure you have all the nutrients the body needs to function optimally will enhance your immune system and help you avoid illness, but eventually we all die, so that means our immune systems do not protect us forever. but it can keep you from getting this virus in the first place or, if you do, from it being at its most deadly. but that's a lifetime commitment to health. peace.",

                    "troubador, here is a more recent article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4103721/. you cited a 1992 study that concluded that garlic had some anti-viral properties but only in vitro, not in real humans. it has never, to my knowledge, been used as an anti-viral traditionally. it has been used for all of recorded history as an anti-fungal and anti-bacterial in actual humans. my own background is certainly not in medicine, but i managed health food stores for 18 years and never was a claim made by garlic supplement manufacturers that it was anti-viral. if it is, it's not very strong. as for your flu treatments, first, if you weren't tested for the flu, you don't actually know that's what you had. we colloquially refer to lots of illnesses as the flu, but most of them are not in fact influenza. anyone can recover from an illness quickly. we might associate things we do with that but we can't actually prove it. you quote linus pauling. but all of his work on vitamin c failed. this is recognized by natural practitioners any by him before he died, but his legacy lives on. he was obviously not a medical specialist. but i will concede that vitamin c does help the immune system in that it is the most important and wide ranging antioxidant in our bodies. but the amount you admit to taking can kill you. it can tear holes in your digestive system. i wouldn't encourage anyone else to try this. a sauna might help you with minor illnesses. i used to go out for a long hard run at the first sign of illness to burn out the toxins more quickly. it worked when i was young enough to do that. for me. not for anyone else necessarily. i do take vitamin c, but again, your quantities can be lethal. it's an acid, and it can be hard on the stomach even in small amounts for some people. it does come in buffered forms that temper its acidity, and that's why it is supposed to be taken with a meal. but a sauna takes a lot out of you. this virus, or true influenza for a weakened person, is pretty potent so i'm just a lot more cautious than you are in what i would recommend. someone with a fever is already burning up. you are fine doing whatever you want, and if it works for you, and doesn't harm you, we're all fine with it. i'm just a lot more cautious recommending extreme measures to others. chris cuomo, by the way, did not have an easy time of it. he's still not back to his usual self weeks after he got diagnosed. he's an extremely fit bodybuilder known for his intense workouts, so he's also a lot stronger than most on here. his family had a much milder time of it, thank god. but he was in pretty dire straits there for a couple of days. as for arguing covid isn't a flu, it's not an argument, it's a fact. they are different viruses entirely, not in the same family. covid is in the same family as the common cold, sars, mers. not influenza. totally different things. now, i take olive leaf and elderberry, which are reputed to have some anti-viral effects, as well as zinc lozenges for the immune system at the first sign of an illness, but to my knowledge i haven't had covid and i've never been tested when i've been sick as to whether it was influenza or not. i do recommend maintaining a strong immune system through diet. i'm a user of supplements. just a lot more cautious than you are and skeptical equally of all forms of medicine for over-claiming. peace.",
                    "by the way, i\"m not saying don't take garlic if you want. it's a great food. but i'll also add, i never sold an anti-viral formulated by herbalists that relied on garlic. even in the study cited, they attack a herpes virus, and if you look, say, at a cold sore herpes formula it will usually rely on lysine and melissa (lemon balm). if you look at formulas for chronic herpes, the main herb is usually st. johns wort. i claim no expertise, just reporting what i was told by those who did have it. but again, for all those out there, while huge quantities of vitamin c might harm you, garlic in proper amounts is always fine as long as it's the right form to be useful, and i don't know what form that would be as it comes in many forms including just ingesting raw garlic and in that test tube study the authors could not conclude what in garlic made it work or how strongly it worked.",

                    "as one of those warning caution, annie is where i am on this. i do take a lot of supplements -- i spent 18 years in the health food biz and you can't help but get into them. so just to say, i take a fairly high amount daily, about 1500mg. i wasn't telling anyone not to take it. i take it. i take it in a combination that helps with allergies. i also use zinc lozenges at the first sign of feeling something coming on, but only two a day as again zinc can be toxic in high dosages. so just to make clear, vitamin c is an essential antioxidant, probably the most essential, and as mentioned above it is water soluble so it doesn't stay in the system very long. you can't finesse that by taking timed release, as they don't actually work most of the time -- when you evacuate it's sitting in the intestinal tract and it goes bye bye. that's what they call expensive toilet water. so you do have to take it more than once a day if you believe it is helpful and want it to stay in the body. we were reacting to the humongous amount suggested by the one poster, not to vitamin c in reasonable dosages.",
                    "and as to the protection of vitamin e, you'll need more than c. for one thing, tocopherols are only one part of vitamin e. tocotrienols are perhaps more important, but aren't in most e supplements, but then, most of us don't need e supplements. but c isn't fat soluble and e is. so you want fat soluble antioxidants as well so you get at all of the e. one way to do that is to take lipoic acid, which is rare in that it protects both fat soluble and water soluble nutrients. it protects vitamin c from oxidizing. but again, be careful folks. zinc is essential but toxic if you take too much. for those who take multiple supplements, make sure there isn't b6 in all of them, for example, as it can cause a form of neuropathy and it's often in all kinds of formulas. same with zinc. selenium is also toxic if you take too much, so you only need a little. as for d, there was some research a few years ago that lowered the recommended dose from 1000 iu a day to 800. so 2000 might be too much for a particular individual. this has only become necessary as we've become indoor creatures. when they told us to cover up when we go outside to protect us from skin cancer and to avoid the sun during peak hours they caused us to not get enough d, which is made by contact with sunshine. so now we have to supplement. keveen is right, it all goes together, and it is very complicated, and there is nothing near consensus on what's appropriate, what's too much, what works and what doesn't. we can fix this by putting as much effort into this as we do patent medicine, but there's not the profit to be made so the money isn't there. sad. and if you look like superman, it doesn't mean you are superman. most who look like superman take steroids, and they don't do so well health-wise and age very oddly. better to look like olive oyl and have no health problems.",
                    "the poster taking 1,000 mg of vitamin c every waking hour is me - careful, though, i was referring to the situation where i get the flu, and i don't do that for more than 2-3 of days, depending on how early i realize i have been infected - if it's very early, i stop after just a few doses (lasting half a day or so), and i'm fine afterwards. normally, when i'm healthy, i take 5,000 mg per day (in one dose), and that's it. please don't misinterpret what i said.",
                    "troubadour, yesterday i went back up to re-read the posts where you were talking about amounts and did see that you were talking about using that high of a dose only when you had the flu. i was going to post a clarification (even typed it), but couldn't figure out how to say \"the amount mentioned was not 1,000 an hour every single day; it's 'merely' 5,000 mg daily,\" because 5,000 is itself more than twice the recommended dose. if you're a linus pauling fan, i assume you don't think there are risks to taking megadoses, but that's a lot of vitamin c.",
                    "troubador, we all have things we do when we get sick. maybe they work, and maybe it's just a coincidence. normally i wouldn't say anything about this, but because of covid and the warnings about its co-existence with flu next fall and winter, everyone needs to know that unless you get a test you have no idea if you have the flu or have had the flu. could be a cold, another corona virus. could be lots of different viruses or minor bacterial infections or sometimes even really bad allergy reactions. when i was a kid, everything was \"a\" flu, as some these days are saying, but influenza now has to be looked at differently and more correctly by all of us. if i got a stomach problem, it was the intestinal flu. if i got certain symptoms it was the 24 hour flu. lots of flus. but none of them was influenza, and we now must all recognize that unless you're in a hospital because you're very young or very old with lots of health problems, none of us have probably ever been tested to see if we had actual influenza. i never have, and that's after 67 years on the planet and that covers a lot of bouts of illness when i was in school. given that i'm guessing all of us when we don't feel well just hunker down until we feel better again, get plenty of sleep, and do our anecdotal things we do in a kind of magical thinking without any actual proof it's doing anything because we don't double-blind test ourselves and don't bother with doctors or tests, will we now have to get tested every time we don't feel well? as for that 5000mg of c a day, i would say, although i don't see any reason to take that much daily, if you do find it makes you feel safer to do so, taking it all at one time is self-defeating. your body can't assimilate that much, and given that vitamin c makes people urinate more frequently anyway, most of it's gone into your toilet water. if you truly want to have that much working for you take it in divided doses, some with each meal, and that way it will have a better possibility of being utilized. as for linus pauling, remember, he had no expertise in health. clearly he was brilliant in his field, but health wasn't his field. what he was trying to learn is if we can live forever by using antioxidants, and he settled on vitamin c because when he started we knew a lot about it but didn't know about all the other antioxidants we now know are much more powerful. his work proved nothing, which is still a positive contribution as it told us what didn't work. since then research has moved on to a variety of powerful antioxidants, and how different ones protect different parts of the body. c isn't any longer the center of the antioxidant universe. science moves on. peace, all.",
                    "paxiled, what other powerful antioxidants are you referring to, and what dosage is recommended? a reference would be appreciated, thank you.",
                    "i won't get into dosages, because the research isn't specific enough and there is no consensus, but anyone can either follow the recommendations on a label of a quality manufacturer or do one's own research. an easy way to deal with this issue would also be to buy a good book on antioxidants. that being said, here are some: glutathione is the main antioxidant protecting both the eyes and the liver. it isn't absorbed if you take it as a supplement, though it is available, but you can get it by using wheat grass regularly. as the liver is so important, this one is very important to have. the various carotenoids all have protective effects. everyone knows about beta carotene, which gives us the safe way to take vitamin a without toxicity to the liver, but few know about all the others. any time you have a colored vegetable, the color is largely from carotenoids. two i'll mention are lycopene, in red foods, which protects the prostate, and lutein, in green foods, which protects the eyes. of course, they protect other things as well. lipoic acid protects vitamin c and the liver from oxidation, as well as providing energy to our cells and cardiovascular system. pycnogenol from pine bark extract or the more generic proanthacyanadins from grape seeds may be the most powerful antioxidant we have, and works with vitamin c. so just a couple of examples, as i'm not the one to write this book. virtually every herb you've heard of that is helpful is helpful because of powerful antioxidants, such as berries, green and white tea, algae, turmeric, and, well, etc. etc. antioxidants are everywhere in plant food, most abundant in fruits and vegetables, not in animal food much. put them all together and theoretically we live forever, which is what linus pauling and others such as the life extension institute were and are chasing, but haven't found of course. prevent cell death and they think we can all be immortal.",
                    "meaning, i should add, there are a ton of them and i can't possibly put them all in here nor do i know all of them. most vitamins have some antioxidant activity, some a lot. many minerals have some antioxidant activity. all plants have some antioxidant activity and some have a ton. that's why they always say, a balanced diet high on veggies, moderate fruit intake (only because of the sugar intake), moderate animal protein mostly from the ocean, and there you have it, eat enough stuff and you get enough. want a lot more, take vitamin, mineral, and herbal supplements. peace, all.",
                    "and i never give references. or mostly never. the reason is, which reference would i cite that is definitive? most medical issues have no consensus. the fact \"mainstream\" medicine goes one way mostly doesn't mean that's accurate, it usually means pharmaceutical companies or textbooks written by doctors paid in part by pharmaceutical companies has a point of view that is what docs learn in school and is in their diagnostic manuals, but may or may not be the best medicine. looking backward, virtually everything we believed was true in medicine proved not to be or proved to be incomplete. no reason to assume the future won't be the same. that's because the body is very hard to understand. individuals differ a lot, as we're seeing with the covid virus in a way folks may not have been exposed to as much before. and it's because medicine is a business, and as long as that's the case there's an incentive to overpromise and exaggerate and oversell. we all do it in whatever it is we do for a living. doctors aren't different. so you can google and come up with a reference that has been gamed by those who know how to game google, and unless you go a hundred pages into it that's what we see. what is harder to find are the dissidents, and almost always it's some of the dissidents who prove to be right in the long run. the same is true for natural medicine. we have historical use, but much of what we take now doesn't have long histories of use because we use it differently now. take vitamin c. the ancients knew foods high in vitamin c were good for you, but they didn't have the technology to isolate vitamin c. because we can isolate things now using modern technology, what is known about it is brand new and therefore we can't say we know what the long-term benefits and detriments truly are. the same is true for pharmaceutical and surgical medicine -- we've only been doing it for a very short time, and so we're still learning. if i cite a reference or you cite a reference, anyone can come up with a contrary reference. so it's best to do your own homework and make up your own mind unless there's consensus, and why i can list a ton of antioxidants, anyone who has any experience with food and supplements can do that, it's common knowledge these substances exist. what isn't common knowledge is whether isolated supplements are necessary, work, are harmful, how much is best to take, etc. we can only do the best we can with the information we have until as a species humans decide finding this stuff out is more important than other things we do. so far that's not the case. peace again, and sorry for the long post but this stuff comes up all over this website and in our daily lives and it's important folks know we don't know what others tell us we know, we just have information and we all try to do the best we can and some try to harm us by spreading false information that makes them a lot of money. so again, do your own homework and may it work out well for everyone. wow. too many words. this stuff is what we used to argue about on the forums for natural medicine, but nobody contributes to them anymore, alas.",

(we quarantined for 14 days out of an abundance of caution.) day 2: six days after day 1, we woke up with the exact same symptoms we had individually experienced on day 1: partner had trouble breathing, i had nausea, and we both had full body aches and chills. these symptoms lasted maybe 5-6 hours this time. again, once they were over, they were over. we were back to feeling normal by that evening. day 3: just yesterday (just over 3 weeks since day 1 and about 2.5 weeks since day 2) we both started feeling ill again after a couple weeks of feeling fine. this time, our symptoms started at around 6:30pm and they lasted about 3 hours. the freaky part was that our symptoms flared up almost down to the minute and came on like a light switch. within 20 minutes or so we both went from feeling fine to feeling chills, aches, nausea, and partner had tightness of chest again. we are both mid-twenties, generally healthy, get consistent exercise, etc. outside of partner's immune system (iga deficiency) we have no other underlying conditions. between our symptom flare ups, we have felt generally well. is this covid and the test just came back false negative, or something else? and why we are experiencing symptoms at nearly the same times?",

                    "same problem. you don't get covid from your body, you get it from breathing it into the sinuses or mouth. the surface thing is purely theoretical, as nobody has ever gone through contact tracing and been found to have gotten the virus from touching a surface. they have all had intimate contact with a human breathing on them. so while it is theoretically possible people are getting it from surfaces, so far nobody has seen it happen in real life. i wouldn't stop taking some precautions, but i've never done the sanitizer thing because sanitizer destroys the immune system on your skin. that can also allow catastrophe to happen if you do it too often, just like taking too many antibiotics can do. but that's me, every expert recommends wiping down door handles and such out of an abundance of caution and so everyone should know that is the expert advice. i don't follow it because i don't believe it makes a difference as long as you wait a bit before touching something others have touched. these are the folks who have not reported any disease formation from touching things: grocery shoppers touching produce others have touched, medical professionals touching things others have touched, etc. etc. in other words, tons of touching of things but no traced disease resulting. doesn't mean it hasn't happened or won't happen, but it's not likely and not a big source of concern when you listen to interviews of those who are treating the disease. also unlikely to get it outdoors, as it doesn't travel well in the outside air. doesn't mean everyone should abandon protective behaviors, but it does mean getting outdoors and moving shouldn't be avoided as the threat is minimal. uvc light can't be used near the face, it will damage eyes, and can't be used inside the mouth or nasal cavity, so what it does isn't what is making people sick as far as we know. what it looks like to me is sort of like hiv, which is present in sperm and theoretically possible to get through oral sex. but nobody ever has, so while no scientist will say it's impossible, they will say it's not a risk. it looks to me, and nobody should act on what things look like to me, is this is like that, theoretically possible but hasn't apparently happened, but who knows? maybe it has. most who have it probably weren't contact traced thoroughly enough to know yet. peace.",

                    "that's true, but if someone is coughing and sneezing and gasping even before covid you probably weren't going to spend a lot of time near that person unless you live in the same house. but if someone is asymptomatic, they don't appear to be a danger, and so they are the super-spreaders. they move around, nobody avoids them, and it is long and intimate contact that produces the most severe cases. look at the recent case in south korea, an asymptomatic guy goes bar hopping and the country is back with clusters of cases. if he had been coughing and gasping nobody would have gotten anywhere near him."

[ ] in order to get infected you need to get exposed to an infectious dose of the virus[.] ... [you can get infected by:] [touching things in a b]athroom: bathrooms have a lot of high-touch surfaces, door handles, faucets, stall doors. transfer risk in this environment can be high. we ... do not know whether a person releases infectious material in feces or just fragmented virus, but we do know that toilet flushing aerosolizes many droplets. treat public bathrooms with extra caution (surface and air), until more is known about the risk. a cough: a single cough releases about 3,000 droplets, and droplets travel at 50 miles per hour. most droplets are large, and fall quickly, but many stay in the air and can travel across a room in a few seconds. a sneeze: a single sneeze releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room). if a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles, which can all be dispersed into the environment around them. a breath: a single breath releases 50 - 5000 droplets. most of these droplets are low velocity, and fall to the ground quickly. there are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. ... all you have to do is enter a room within a few minutes of a cough/sneeze and take a few breaths and you have potentially received enough virus to establish an infection. ... with general breathing of 20 copies [of the virus] per minute into the environment, even if every virus ended up in your lungs, you would need 1000 copies divided by 20 copies per minute: 50 minutes [of exposure]. speaking increases the release of respiratory droplets about 10 fold; ~200 copies of virus per minute. again, assuming every virus is inhaled, it would take ~5 minutes of speaking face-to-face to receive the required dose. anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with in a face-to-face situation is potentially infectious [or could get infected by you]. ... it appears approximately 40% of all infections -- and the majority of community-acquired transmissions -- have occurred from people without symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). you can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin. ... social-distancing rules are to protect you with brief exposures, or outdoor exposures. social-distancing guidelines don't hold in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room have gotten infected. if you are in an open-floorplan office ... critically assess the risk (volume, people, and airflow). if you are in a job that requires face-to-face talking or even worse, yelling, you should assess [whether the risk is worth it to you]. ... even if gung-ho for resuming business as usual, do your part and wear a mask to reduce what you release into the environment. ... infected respiratory droplets land somewhere. wash your hands often and stop touching your face.",

(someone not associated with the nursing home) was quarantined in the seattle area january 15, as were 60 people with whom that person had had contact, the virus was not contained by this, and in short order made it into the nursing home. the government response was sluggish, and while i'm sure the nursing home followed the rules they use for flu or legionella, the lockdown was not as immediate or severe as it would be if this happened now. for example, the nursing home would call the fire department for an emt emergency, and who knows if the fire department was aware what they were dealing with and everyone masked up and so forth, and for a while the nursing home was still transferring patients in and out, and for a short while family members were still allowed to visit. this did get locked down quite fast, but i remember that the news reports at that time were that it was very confusing. if the case you are asking about was from back then, you'd have to judge it with a different level of expectation that they knew what they were doing, than if you are asking about something that happened in the past month.",

                    "why do you think germany has had the best responses so far?",
                    "probably it's a cultural thing. germans do what they're told. americans don't. it's what makes both countries very successful in normal times. germany has for many many years other than after losing wars it started been the technological and scientific leader of the world. we all know they make the best cars, best appliances, etc. who knows why they developed this culture, but they did. but it's also probably just blind luck -- they haven't had as many cases as other countries to begin with. but their death rate is unbelievably low and they reacted very quickly and efficiently, which is kind of their thing. but other countries have as well. some scandinavian countries reacted well. by and large hong kong, japan, singapore and south korea reacted very well. but the first three had different experiences getting to a good point and there are signs it is coming back. not so with south korea which also acted quickly and also has the best per capita testing of any other country, i believe. basically, they also have competent leadership and people who listened. italy has a very divided country right now and poor leadership as a result and had a huge problem. same with spain. same with the us. again, we're not supposed to get into \"politics\" but how the place you live is governed has a lot to do with how well you react to problems when they arise. it is what it is."

                "content": "\"am i at greater risk of developing severe illness should i be infected?\" hi, arturo; this is my rough interpretation: because of your valve problem, with every beat there is some backflow of blood and so there is reduced blood flow going out. on top of that, by itself getting covid can make anybody's heart muscle perform less well; and so that also causes a reduced blood flow going out. your total reduction of outgoing blood flow can therefore be greater than if you didn't have the valve problem. let's see what the american cardiologist group says about ordinary flu: \"acute viral infections have three categories of short-term effects on the cardiovascular system: ... second, myocardial depression leading to heart failure. ...\" from https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/01/08/42/feature-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-provides-potent-reminder-of-the-risk-of-infectious-agents \"myocardial depression\" means the heart muscle isn't working so good. in sepsis from the cov infection, the flood of inflammatory chemicals are involved in that. \"heart failure\" means not pumping out enough blood. but the \"failure\" presumably can be temporary if heart muscle is not permanently damaged. however, the effect can still be devastating in the short term. none of that, though, tells you how much greater risk there is for you.",
