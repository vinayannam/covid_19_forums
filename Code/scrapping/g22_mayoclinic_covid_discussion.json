I have not resorted to medications other than aspirin, a topical cream and ice pack but may be looking into other medications after I give it another few months to see if it gets under control again.  This still all new to me!  I am 74.  I have read a lot of comments on erythromelalgia and understand my pain and flare is not as bad as many people face but it is still there.   I have wondered if anyone with neuropathy and/or erythromelalgia (specifically) has received the Covid vaccine and what has been your results.

Best, Hank\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nPfizer\u2019s vaccine is the first on the market that consists of actual genetic information from a virus in the form of messenger RNA, or mRNA, a type of molecule whose usual job is to transport copies of genetic instructions around a cell to guide the assembly of proteins. Imagine an mRNA as a long ticker tape carrying instructions. It's fairly delicate stuff, and that's why Pfizer's vaccine needs to be kept at around -100 \u00b0F (-73 \u00b0C) until it's used.\nThe new vaccine, delivered as a shot in the arm muscle, contains an RNA sequence taken from the virus itself; it causes cells to manufacture the big \u201cspike\u201d protein of the coronavirus, which the pathogen uses to glom onto a person\u2019s cells and gain entry. On its own, without the rest of the virus, the spike is pretty harmless. But your body still reacts to it. This is what leaves you immunized and ready to repel the real virus if it turns up.\nThe mRNA in the vaccine, to be sure, isn\u2019t quite the same as the stuff in your body. That\u2019s good, because a cell is full of defenses ready to chop up RNA, especially any that doesn\u2019t belong there. To avoid that, what\u2019s known as \u201cmodified nucleosides\u201d have been substituted for some of the mRNA building blocks.\nBut Pfizer is holding back a little. The spike gene sequence can be tweaked in small ways for better performance, by means that include swapping letters. We don\u2019t think Pfizer has said exactly what sequence it is using, or what modified nucleosides. That means the content of the shot may not be 100% public.\nThe lipids\nThe Pfizer vaccine, like one from Moderna, uses lipid nanoparticles to encase the RNA. The nanoparticles are, basically, tiny greasy spheres that protect the mRNA and help it slide inside cells.\nThese particles are probably around 100 nanometers across. Curiously, that\u2019s about the same size as the coronavirus itself.\nPfizer says it uses four different lipids in a \u201cdefined ratio.\u201d The lipid ALC-0315 is the primary ingredient in the formulation. That\u2019s because it\u2019s ionizable\u2014it can be given a positive charge, and since the RNA has a negative one, they stick together. It's also a component that can cause side-effects or allergic reactions. The other lipids, one of which is the familiar molecule cholesterol, are \u201chelpers\u201d that give structural integrity to the nanoparticles or stop them from clumping. During manufacturing, the RNA and the lipids are stirred into a bubbly mix to form what the FDA describes as a \u201cwhite to off-white\u201d frozen liquid.\nSalts\nThe Pfizer vaccine contains four salts, one of which is ordinary table salt. Together, these salts are better known as phosphate-buffered saline, or PBS, a very common ingredient that keeps the pH, or acidity, of the vaccine close to that of a person\u2019s body. You\u2019ll understand how important that is if you\u2019ve ever squeezed lemon juice on a cut. Substances with the wrong acidity can injure cells or get quickly degraded.\nSugar\nThe vaccine includes plain old sugar, also called sucrose. It\u2019s acting here as a cryoprotectant to safeguard the nanoparticles when they\u2019re frozen and stop them from sticking together.\nSaline solution\nBefore injection, the vaccine is mixed with water containing sodium chloride, or ordinary salt, just as many intravenously delivered drugs are. Again, the idea is that the injection should more or less match the salt content of the blood.\nNo preservatives\nPfizer makes a point of saying its mixture of lipid nanoparticles and mRNA is \u201cpreservative-free.\u201d That\u2019s because a preservative that\u2019s been used in other vaccines, thimerosal (which contains mercury and is there to kill any bacteria that might contaminate a vial), has been at the center of worries around over whether vaccines cause autism. The US Centers for Disease Control says thimerosal is safe; despite that, its use is being phased out. There is no thimerosal\u2014or any other preservative\u2014in the Pfizer vaccine. No microchips, either.\nThe vaccine is still known by the code name BNT162b, but once it\u2019s authorized, expect Pfizer to give it a new, commercial name that conveys something about what\u2019s in it and what it promises for the world.\n",

The nurse coordinator has said that if we choose to get vaccinated then we should do our laboratories once a week.

I really want to have the vaccination and from everything I have read many transplant centers feel that any potential side-effects for us are not as bad as if we should get Covid, and when you combine age with that it's even worse.

I am sorry you had this experience with your PCP. I hope you are able to work out a better system to contact them in the future. Many doctor's offices have processes for patients who need assistance after hours or when they can't reach their usual doctor. \nAt Mayo Clinic, transplant patients are all given a card with an after hours phone number to contact the organ transplant physician on-call. This number reaches someone 24 hours a day/7 days a week in case of a patient emergency. Our hope is that our patients use this number in situations similar to yours, when they need assistance, but don't feel the situation requires 911. Many other hospitals have a similar system. Everyone should ask their doctors how best to contact them during and after business hours. Of note, patient portals are nice for communication, but keep in mind they should not be used for urgent matters. While we usually handle messages within a day, Mayo Clinic has a 2-4 day turn around expectation to patient portal messages. If you require immediate assistance, the portal may not be your best method of contacting your doctor as it may take them a day or more to get to your message. \n",

He didn't order a DEXA for me for five years after having a DEXA showing osteopenia.  I had a minor hip fracture which made me ask him if I should have a DEXA.  Sure enough, I was very overdue so he ordered one and I have advanced osteoporosis.  His excuses for not ordering a DEXA were very flimsy.

I only believe the online sites if there are enough individual reviews to be a good sampling.  If there are five or less I figure that they can too easily be skewed.  \nMy new PCP was one I was considering when I chose the PCP I had.  I had three doctors under consideration and she was one of them.  I had a few women PCPs before that and they seemed less interested in their patients, I believe their family involvement with their children took a strong priority and their patients came in a distant second.  For that reason, I chose to go with the man.  I think the woman I am currently seeing is not married so that would not be the case.  I have to admit, the man I was going to was very caring and when I was struggling pre-transplant he often called me to see how I was doing and he kept track of me all the time.  The two things I had against him though were dropping the ball on my osteoporosis, and long before that, not diagnosing my cirrhosis.  I was sent to a neurologist because they thought one of my symptoms was neurological and he was the one who said he thought the problem was my liver!  Had it not been for him I don't know how much longer it would have taken to get a diagnosis.

Also, there is conflicting advice about whether people with major allergic reactions, like anaphylaxis, should be inoculated or not. I have read that if you choose to have the vaccine then you must tell the vaccinators your history so that they can be prepared to treat you if you do have a reaction.

I thought that I was an expert on waiting due to waiting for transplant, but this is a difficult wait for me.

This is what we have now and to me as a lung cancer survivor, it's a fine beginning!\nDr. Fauci explained why it's important, imperative to get vaccinated.:\n\"Vaccines can protect against serious diseases, including hospitalization and death,\" Fauci said. \"They could also keep variants from becoming more dominant.\"\n\"Viruses cannot mutate if they don't replicate. And if you stop their replication by vaccinating widely and not giving the virus an open playing field to continue to respond to the pressures that you put on it, you will not get mutations,\" Fauci said. \n\"You need to get vaccinated when it becomes available as quickly and as expeditiously as possible throughout the country.\"\nExperts remain concerned about the spread of the variants. \"Right now we are in an absolute race against time with these variants, with trying to get people vaccinated before they spread too much across our country,\" said emergency physician Dr. Megan Ranney, director of the Brown-Lifespan Center for Digital Health in Rhode Island. \"It means that just going to the grocery store, to school, or to work could become more dangerous. We have an already overtaxed and exhausted health care system.\"\nPresently there are three variants in the US. We do need to stop them and getting vaccinated will help stop it.

I have multiple serious conditions, including a 2nd blood clot December 21st.  There's so much info to say we shouldn't take it and its very confusing and worrisome.\n  I have GCA and was on Prednisone for one year and then coupled with Actemra since November,  2019.  My WCB eventually crashed at 0.9, and neutrophils at 1.2 so was stopped both, as well as Clozapine, immediately.  Brutal 6-week withdrawal but ok now. Back on only Actemra every two weeks rather than weekly, as long as my lab results remain steady. I get a weekly lab workup to monitor.\n My rheumatologist yesterday decided that getting the vaccine is worth the risk for me.  Better the vaccine side effects than getting Covid, she said.  She's very knowledgeable on the subject, having been to seminars as well as doing her own research.  I trust her implicitly.  My G.P. told me I would never survive Covid, and my rheumatologist agrees.\n  I hope this helps you.  Good luck to you with your difficult decision.  \nP.S.  Just to clarify,  my rheumatologist said the doctors just don't KNOW at this time how the Covid vaccine will affect immunosuppressed patients because no studies have yet been done on that.  In the UK, they've immunized frail, older people but not immunosuppressed people, as such, with few problems.  We have to make our individual decisions, with the guidance of our medical teams.  I guess we're guinea pigs, but in my case I feel it's worth the risk.\nGood luck and best wishes.\n",

She never had PMR or any immune issues before that, but her SED and C Reactive Protein levels were out of control by the time she made it to the doctor for blood work. Within 3 or 4 days of the vaccine, she was immobile (tears trying to get out of bed to shuffle to the bathroom) and in excruciating pain, joints all over her body (not just shoulders and hips) and could not even lift a glass of water to drink it. She developed difficulty breathing and swallowing and had low pulse oxygen. I don't think the ordinary vaccine side effects are anything like that and it seems that her response was rare, but not unheard of. Still the rheumatologist did not believe it was related to the vaccines, but we are not at all convinced. She had been going to the gym and taking daily walks. This was a radical change. I don't know that I would avoid the Shingrix because of this, but I just never want her to go through anything like that again (a flare-up of PMR), hence the question.\n",

The cardinals, woodpecker (1), bob-white, and others AND all the squirrels give me joy, peace, I seem to breath so much better and have a persistent smile. I've stopped 'fighting' the squirrels. Let them win. I actually enjoy them, love to see them hang by their tiny little toes, upside down, stretched out the whole length of their bodies to reach the birdseed. Even a fall is ok. They just run off and then back for more. The birds are in charge, tho. When they come to feed, they let the squirrels know it's time to step aside. What fun. My kitty, Samantha, loves to go out and just lie down and watch the activity. She's never tried to chase any of the visitors. Seems to enjoy them\u2026.and they watch her but accept her just fine. She welcomes these visitors to her world. BTW:  the cardinals come back year after year, new families and I get to watch the babies learn from Mom and Dad and snack at my feeders. They know me!

He really distressed the bird in the live oak tree in front of my unit! It a fairly large oak now, birds and squirrels love it. There are several squirrel nests in there now. We used to have possoms, raccoons, rabbits, and rats of course from the creek!, water moccassins (sp?), black snakes, etc. Gobs of little brown lizards, from S. America I think?

Great explanation and photo of this clever, enterprising little fella'.  \nWith sub-zero ice and snow, I've emptied a 35 lb bag of bird seed over the past three days.  Precious kitty and I have sat entranced watching the multitude of birds at both the hanging and ground feeders.  They mound on top of one another at the ground feeders and it only takes about 15 mins once being set out/refilled for the tons of birds to appear.  Also keeping busy adding large containers of luke warm water for them and they actually circle around \"waiting their turns \" for drinks.  Had wondered if birds would use snow for water but they seem to appreciate the frequently refillled water containers.  The birds leave at sunset so I set out more birdseed for the squirrels.\nI was truly alarmed to see a beautiful, well cared for/fed cat sitting in the snow by my backyard fence the other day.  By the time I'd gotten dry food and water out to the yard, the cat had left the yard.  Experiencing the most dire weather here in over 70 yrs, I thought bacl to earlier winters when I'd make a comfy winter bed with heat lamp for my wonderful Sunshine dog.  Did the same for the unknown kitty and so happy to report that \"somebody\" has found the garage petdoor and is taking advantage of our impromptu pet motel these last few days/nights!  By the time I turn on the garage light, the \"guest (s)? have left but the food is gone and the comfy spots have been ruffled.\nFor all reasons, I'm hoping this arctic weather crisis passes quickly.  \n",

Immunosuppression is troublesome for respiratory viruses.  We always are cautious and careful. COVID-19 offers new concern because it is an unknown \u2013 no vaccine \u2013 and we don't know if the trajectory of the illness is going up or down.  Thinking all this through, I have self-isolated even though there are only 2 cases in my county (Arizona).  So, we are also watching church service online. My heart transplant was 3 years ago and I am still on prednisone and, of course, mycophenalate and sirolimus.  I wonder if I am actually more protected than others from the virus because of the steroid.  No other respiratory virus has been shown to affect potential rejection so I wouldn't think the COVID-19 would.  These are good questions for our doctors!  Take care everyone and stay healthy.

My daughter never had colds/flu\u2026until she moved out at 24, started eating packaged foods, and had so many respiratory infections that her insurance dumped her. All that was 26 years ago.\nMy husband traveled, doing nine trade shows in the outdoor industry every winter, some of them back-to-back. Days of driving, followed by other exhibitors and the public all hacking, sneezing, coughing. He's a brittle diabetic and, during those years, had very low kidney function. I pre-cooked meals for him to heat up in the microwave in his room; he made sandwiches and took fresh fruit for lunches. In spite of his health issues, he never, ever had even a sniffle all those years! He quit doing shows for the company when he went on dialysis, subsequently got a kidney transplant six years ago and, of course, is on immunosuppresents. He's never had a cold or flu since the transplant. We quit doing anything other than simple hand washing 5\u00bd years ago.\nAvoiding the additives and chemicals in processed foods is a huge step towards staying safe. Cooking many things from scratch is not terribly difficult. I do use a few canned items, like tomato paste (not sauce, which is full of salt) that have nothing other than the food itself. Naturally, I avoid any canned item that has salt. Due to his diabetes and both of our kidney issues, I avoid using salt, sugar, and fat in everything I prepare. Making pasta sauce from canned tomato paste only requires adding herbs and enough water to yield the right consistency, with a pinch of sugar to bring out the natural tomato flavor. How much more difficult is that than heating bottled sauce that's full of chems and salt, perhaps sugar? \n",

My meld started out at 19 and ended up 33.  I had 12 ERCP procedures that placed a stent in the bile duct to ease flow prior to transplant. MY physical strength has lessened as I try to be as active as I once was but have accepted the common sense approach to do what I can.  I am blessed.

        "content": "@devonsnana ..thank you for your response.\nWe have some of the same autoimmune diseases and then some different.. I am concerned about the reaction to the vaccine too because I have that sensitivity to epinephrine that happens where you receive a numbing shot at the dentist (it contains epinephrine) and I get instant palpitations and my heart speeds up as in the pulse. My chests feels this fast heart rate and it continues for about 10 min- 1/2 hour. I was told by my endocrinologist to tell the dentist's to use the other kind of numbing shot without the epinephrine. To avoid the problem of the palpitations and being shakey for 1/2 an hour which is a danger to your heart. I usually have them put it in my file. Not always do the dentist's CHECK though! So I have to verbally bring it up. \nI've forgotten to tell a dentist and then boom! Too late. There it goes again.\nMy experience without it was much different. No problems then.\n There is one drawback. The numbing shot without the epinephrine doesn't stop the bleeding as well, so on an extraction you will need more. I therefore, recently had an extraction and took the regular numbing shot and the epinephrine to avoid excessive bleeding. (Against my endo dr's advice,)\nSo because I am so sensitive to outside agents, which affect my~ ENDOCRINE SYSTEM~ I am asking for guidance on this issue as well as to if there has been scientific data put out on the RISK to taking this Moderna vaccine.\nOur county is going to give our group the Moderna this next Thursday, so I don't have much time to decide!\nAlso, I was sensitive to getting ALLERGY tested this last year. When the medical assistant put the square with all of the types of possible substances you can be allergic to on my arm (it pricks your skin with like 20 or 30 at a time) then said we had to wait ..after less than 5 minutes I started to have racing heart feeling and tightness in my throat..\nSo I pressed the button for help that he left me with.\nHe quickly removed the testing and wiped my arm off. He took my BP and said it wasn't abnormal but that his head dr said to not proceed with the test but instead they would do a blood test to find out what I was allergic to.\nThe symptoms went away ..subsided ..after he removed the allergens from my arm FYI.\nHe said it was highly irregular and that this isn't a \"normal\" reaction that they usually see.. I said I am never \"normal\" and if something is rare, I will get it or it will happen to me when.it comes to medicine.\nI'm that person who it will happen too in the part of the drug warnings of \"this is a rare side effect\"!!\n\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude44..\nAnd then the  time, I had a flu shot or my pneumonia 2nd shot given to me at Walgreens. I can't recall which one it was. So about 15 min \u2013 1/2 hour later I start getting a rashy type thing in and around the area. It felt warm to touch too. I told them I thought it was a reaction. They retorted that it was just a normal reaction to a shot..\nGuess what. I was right!\nIt got red, inflamed and rashy all the way down to my elbow.\nI went to URGENT CARE. They said it looked like staph under the skin or what is it, phlebitis? Infection like staph but under the skin. Antibiotics to the rescue!\nI said well the only way I could have that would be that the person giving the vaccine wasn't careful about cleaning everything involved then.(I am assuming)\nSo I don't know if this would be relevant, but figured I'd add it, in case.\nAnother point\u2026 I was tested by lab in CA called AVISE. THEY do the deep detail testing for autoimmune markers and antibodies and the markers. I was tested for Lupus, RA and thyroid is.\nThe results came back for very high autoimmune is reference to the thyroid. Already being treated for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, no surprise on that.\nAnd.. the ANA markers for a few things were positive. Finally after years of clinical symptoms got diagnosed for Lupus (in Sept '20)\nTaking Hydroxychloroquine 200 2x a day. Just stopped prednisone this last week and I read that it stays in your system.\nWith hydroxychloroquine, I was told by the pharmacist and another person who takes it,  it lowers your immune system.\nSo looking for answers here on Mayo Connect to should I get the vaccine or no it? I used to be very active on Mayo Connect years ago, but haven't now been using it as a source on a regular basis for about 4 yrs.\nDarlia\n",

Plus having as thyroid condition, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is only one of my many autoimmune disorders. The endocrine system .. and my autoimmune markers specifically for the thyroid are really high which shows up in my labs and tells me that even while on medication, the autoimmune markers are high so then how does that equate to if it's ok or not to take the vaccine? That's what I'm trying to find out. Don't feel bad if no one at Mayo knows the answers.  The CDC post on their own website under Autoimmune disorders doesn't even know.

There are studies going on now for many different illnesses and diseases. It's only been a year since we've had this virus so not every group has been tested. I'm sure that there will be many changes that we will see in the future.\nThis site might have some answers for you:\nhttps://www.lupus.org/resources/covid19-vaccine-and-lupus#\nI have Discoid Lupus that has been in remission for years.

I'm doing good to get one or two at most.\nSo the Dr.'s I have all tell me to get the vaccine because I'm in the high risk group.

It was that 2-3 hours later when an unforeseen event sent me into first anger and fear and then major panic and anxiety.  It was mostly continuous for about 12 hours till I went to bed.  The anxiety persisted all through today, so about 4 days thus far. The kind of anxiety where you can't breathe, shaking inside, nausea, etc\u2026  I got very worried immediately after the initial anxiety started because I know it could affect the vaccine and immunity.  That led to more anger, anxiety and feeling like I am no longer protected from Covid like I should have been.  Anyone with anxiety knows how this never ending loop goes!  I did start medication today which has helped a bit.  I am hoping that since it takes a couple weeks to even create the immunity (from what I read) that my immune system can calm down and still create ample antibodies to that 95% efficacy. \nAs for the side effects.

The suggestion is that they might interfere with kick starting your immune system.

There really isn't enough data as yet to suggest that there is a significant reduction in immunity if you need to take medications prior to the vaccine. When I have to take an antibiotic I usually get tired after a couple of days. Since you had the vaccine and another new medication so close to each other there really isn't any way to tell what caused your fatigue.\nHave you watched Dr. Poland's podcasts?  \n\nI hope that your fatigue is the only side effect so far!

My parents were musicians, Mom was an accomplished violinist, my older sister and I have degrees in music, and all of us 6 learned at least one instrument and sang in church choirs. I was a minister of music for 25 years, and enjoyed the variety of venues that are possible in churches. I\u2019m now retired, but I still play the piano and lead worship for the Sunday evening service. I have a small grand piano that feels abandoned. My piano technician died recently from an out of the blue heart attack, so I may be doing more of the maintenance of the piano. Not my favorite job. \nOne of my cousins studied and practiced music therapy for many years. I had the joy  (mostly joy) of teaching many piano students, from age 5 to 90. I love hearing from them as they pursue their own careers in music. \nIn my own experience, music meant a lot to me professionally, playing various instruments, directing choirs of all ages and abilities, writing music for whatever instruments happened to be available, and directing music departments. I think the most pleasure I receive is in playing the piano in front of appreciative audiences, who don\u2019t hear a lot of acoustic music anymore. I think my favorite church service is Christmas Eve, when we sing carols and read Scripture. And I get to play for it. \nJim\n",

I've played them in several churches for weddings, and the church in San Francisco where I was the music director had a cool old Wurlitzer theater pipe organ that I had restored while I was there. It was great fun. Originally someone would sit backstage and pump it by hand. I didn't care to return it to its pre-electrical state. The louvers to the pipe chambers opened and closed by the volume pedals. The mechanism that did the moving was tied to leather which did the work. I had to have a lot of the leather work redone. \nIt was cool to see in the chambers actual drums and marimba and other instruments that were struck or sounded by air at the organ console.\nWhen my sister was being married to #2, she asked me to play a Widor Toccata. I wasn't able to attend the wedding, but I enjoyed the challenge mastering that very difficult piece.\nOur current church doesn't have an organ, but it does have a nice 9' Steinway piano that needs an overhaul but is a pleasure to play as is. I don't play it very often, and it's only played occasionally by the worship band. Unfortunately the guys who play it are more accustomed to a keyboard. So, any time I do get to play it, many people approach me after the service to express their appreciation of hearing it played the way it deserves to be played. One opportunity to play is the annual Christmas Eve service, when we sing a bunch of carols. They're so diverse, from Silent Night to Joy to the World.

The videos we post today could be quickly outdated with the release of new information.

With the Covid sanitation protocols and need to watch closely for allergic reaction, it may be a lot slower than we all hope. Also remember that at 3-4 weeks after the first dose, the vaccinators must circle back and give each person a second dose, further slowing the process. So far the US has only has contracts  to purchase for roughly half the doses needed to vaccinate everyone. \nTrying to do the math using CDC standards, I estimate that phase 1A \u2013 health care providers and congregate living \u2013 will take at least 2 months (into February) to complete. Then comes 1B \u2013 other essential workers (educators, cashiers, other front line) and those over age 75 \u2013 beginning in February if we are fortunate. Then those with chronic health conditions and those between 75 and 74, maybe in March or April\u2026 \nAnother thing to remember is that each state MAY allot its vaccine differently than the CDC recommendations \u2013 so people will be vaccinated on differing schedules depending upon where they live.\nAll that said, the best way to stay safe is to continue all recommended protocols \u2013 wear a mask, wash your hands, avoid crowds and remain socially distant \u2013 until we reach the \"end of the tunnel\" where we get the vaccine AND wait the recommended time for antibodies to form.\nSue\n",

Through Newsfeed, the Poland Podcasts, the Covid 19 connect group discussions and the regular updates by Colleen Young we've had several avenues to find info. I haven't though been successful finding specifics about if or how or when or from whom I will be able to get the vaccinne, at Mayo. I, like several others in this conversation have multiple Mayo providers, but my PCP is with the Jacksonville Baptist Primary physicians. I keep praying this will change soon so I can have a Mayo PCP. This truly makes it tough for me in several ways. I use both Mayo (wonderful!!!) patient portal and Baptist (awful!!!) patient portal to keep my PCP informed of my progress at Mayo. I send him test results, docs comments and diagnoses and treatments, (he's not rec'd all the records as I requested\u2026.or the office isn't aware of them???) I have an excellent medical team. They do share information among themselves and with me. It's amazingly wonderful. I'm getting diagnoses, removing diagnoses, following results and actually going forward in my health and life. Much improved. BUT, I need the Covid 19 vaccine and can't find out how to get it! Baptist docs don't have access. It's run through the hospital system. Since I deal 199% with Mayo, I haven't ck'd w/Baptist yet. Fl/Jacksonville is now offering through the county health dept vaccines to anyone over 65 by appt only given DT at the Convention Center. If I can't get info re Mayo vaccine and me, I'll contact the health dept and get in line. So, while your info is good, the specific help we're looking for we still can't get. No idea if any of my docs will contact me? Which one? Any guess at time-frame? I think we're a bit lost in this, in the middle of 2 systems\u2026.in my case, 3 systems. Hope some of this add clarity?

From the beginning, the handling of covid-19 and now vaccines for it have been bungled here in the US. And I'm livid about it. There are wasted supplies, mistakes with keeping the vaccines at the temperature that they need to be and a roll-out system that isn't national.\nDespite being told to be patient it's very difficult to remain so.

But, now, to be blunt, the beauracracies are trying to distribute and unless they get out of the way they'll muck it up.

Why did all our Washington congress people -many under 50 and healthy- and some of their staff \u2013 most under 40 and healthy, get shots first? Why are many hospitals giving ALL the staff shots, not just front-line? Why are prisoners in CA and NY?? getting shots BEFORE the elderly, even those in facilities?

Why are the phones not answered on the week-end or only from 8:30 \u2013 5:00? Get more phones, more people to answer, get organized. Stay open!!!!!!!This is a global emergency! I'm horrified at this kind of thinking. \nWhy didn't the CDC have the plans for who gets the shots when, all completed and announced in July or August? Why wait until DEC. 20th to meet and make plans?  That's caused a lot of states to have to hustle and play catch up. \nWhy did and is the FDA only seeing research results when the pharm co is ready to ship out?  Why don't they keep up with the research as it's happening? This should be done as a normal thing. THIS IS A GLOBAL EMERGENCY!  Think out of the box!

(It took researchers almost 20 years to develop the polio vaccine.) It is true that there has not been as much planning for the orderly delivery of the vaccine as we would like, but I believe most people doubted there could possibly be a vaccine this quickly. \nRemember too, the same public health staff responsible for vaccine delivery planning has been overwhelmed just dealing with the pandemic itself for the past 10 months, and received little guidance or funding to help with the rollout. Finally, our health care providers are DEPLETED from this past year, and we are asking them to undertake another monumental task.\nIf you've seen my posts before, you know I am a research nerd, so I just did a little math.\n20 million doses of vaccine have been delivered in the past 2 1/2 weeks, during a time that included 2 major holidays and some major winter storms. That is enough to vaccinate 10 million people. 4-5 million doses have been injected so far, in 18 days. That's remarkable \u2013 about 225,000 doses a day, or 400,000 a day if you just count \"business\" days. Depending on whose estimate you accept, another 50 \u2013 100 million doses will be delivered by February, for 25 \u2013 50 million more people.\nThere are:\n20 million front-line health care workers\n  2 million long-term care residents\n  2 million law enforcement and fire fighters\n20 other essential front-line workers (delivery, cashiers, utility & public works, food production, day care providers, transportation & truckers, etc)\n  4 million K-12 educations workers (incl aides, bus drivers, etc)\n18 million over age 75\nThat's 66 million people needing  over 130 million doses of vaccine. That accounts for all of the vaccine we can expect to be delivered in the next 6 weeks.\nAs you can see, unless you fall into one of the categories above, it is mathematically unlikely that you will be receiving a vaccine in the next few weeks or maybe even months.\nThe way I see it, no matter how much I would like to travel, or to eat out, or ____,  it's hard to justify trying to \"jump the line\" even though I am 69 and high risk, and my husband is over 70 and also high risk.\nSo in the meantime. I will mask up, wash my hands, avoid close contact, and try to be patient.\nSue\n",

The first injection teaches the immune system to recognize a new pathogen by showing it a harmless version of some of the virus\u2019s most salient features. After the body has had time to study up on this material, as it were, a second shot presents these features again, helping immune cells commit the lesson to memory. \nThese vaccines are teachers, intending to give our bodies directions on how to recognize and kill COVID-19. But for it to be effective we need at least 70% of people in the US, and hopefully the world to get both shots. Then it takes about a month after the last one for it to be about 70+% effective.\nI have no idea why the rollout is so slow. But I do know that it gives time to decide whether we will get it and if not why. My decision was easy. I'd much rather have a reaction to the vaccine than to have COVID-19 and all of the possible, horrific side effects that it can cause. A few days in bed, if it comes to that sure beats a lifetime of side effects from covid or death.\nYour decision will also affect those around you.

Yes, there are glitches. Yes, there is confusion. Yes, we all wish it was faster. None of that is the fault of Mayo, or any other provider \u2013 up until now, the states have received an allotment each week (maybe not what was promised) and distributed according to state priorities \u2013 with CDC guidance chaging often.\nFederal contracts are not paused and renegotiated with each adminstration. The current  renegotiation is the new administration trying to secure at least double the number of doses originally ordered (only 200 million were ordered, 600 million doses are needed.) That means  negotiating additional contracts, and has zero impact on the original contracts. To date, about 45 million doses have been delivered to the states.\nThe biggest problem is production \u2013 new product, new process, few facilities stood up. The world needs billions of doses.\nThe second issue is that many states began distribution without regard to how many doses they would have available and/or how explosive the demand would be. They were simply responding to public outcry. If you look at statements made by medical people, not elected officials, going back to last Fall, they told us it would take up to a year to get enough doses of vaccine for everyone in the country. \nFinally, the complexity of this is magnified by the need to give everyone 1) 2 doses, 2) of the same vaccine, 3) at the appropriate interval. There is NO centralized or readily available record-keeping system to manage this task, so EVERY facility needs to stand up their own. This should have been under development by the Feds in parallel with the vaccine development by pharmaceutical companies and we wouldn't have this chaos. To expect all 50 states and the territories to do it individually is ludicrous.\nThe bottom line is, not everyone can be first, or even second or third. It would have been helpful to have a standard, enforced prioritization for vaccine delivery, but that's not the way the Federal government chose to handle it, or anything else related to the pandemic. Now everyone needs to take a deep breath and hope more organization and clarity of information is forthcoming. I hope we may finally be headed in that direction.\nSue \n",

This was the day before Governor Walz announced the vaccine trial at his daily press conference. But Health Partners was picked to enroll 1500 people from the Twin Cities. I wasn't in the high risk occupations they were looking for. But I am person of color and have stable chronic conditions. They are looking for 25% people of color. They are also looking for 25% people over 65. So with phase 3 it seems they are trying to get a cross section of the Twin Cities to include seniors, minorities, and chronic conditions. With phase 2 the subjects were healthy and 18 to 55 years old. \n",

I have to sign it before I can participate. It's a lot of legalese. It said something about covering our unreimbursed medical expenses after our own insurance pays. I don't know what that means because we aren't supposed to be charged for the experimental vaccine and screenings. I don't know if that means expenses for bad reaction to the vaccine or if I get hurt in a car crash. So my appointment is tomorrow morning in Bloomington, MN. It's supposed to be a two hour appointment. I already informed my Mayo Clinic doctor because he has my medical records and knows all about my chronic conditions.

    "author": "yakoubou @yakoubou",
    "content": "California recently re-prioritized COVID vaccination groups/tiers to include those with Type 2 Diabetes with an A1C greater than 7.5, beginning March 15.  If your A1C is any less than that, even with comorbidity recognized by CDC, then it sounds like you might have to wait until your age group is called, which includes healthier people, later this summer, maybe.  Re-prioritization won't solve the vaccine shortage problem, but that's another issue.  I, myself, could potentially stop Metformin and/or Jardiance temporarily and get my A1C up to qualify.  That sounds like a stupid thing to do, and I'm not recommending that anyone do that, but what if I catch COVID before receiving the vaccine?  I don't know which is worse.  Are other states splitting hairs on the degree of disability and high risk health conditions?  When I start thinking about bioethics, it drives me nuts.  There are people far off worse than me.",

We are a community of people living with a variety of health conditions, who help each other on our journeys by sharing our experiences. \nCovid-19 and all of its complications have created an unbelievable level of stress for many of us as we deal with our primary issues. One of the truly most frustrating parts of the equation is the ability to get the vaccine. If you look at the discussions in this Group you will see it is the topic of at least a dozen different ones, and there are more in other groups.\nWhen the vaccine became available, the Federal government made the decision to control the purchase & FLOW of vaccines to the states, make recommendations (not mandates) about prioritizing groups of people to get the vaccine, & leave the creation of standards to the states & territories. Some states have even gone so far as to leave decisions to their counties or cities. As a result, we have hundreds of different sets of rules & priorities \u2013 obviously not an ideal scenario.\nAs for bioethics \u2013 I can tell you from personal knowledge that in Minnesota, it is a huge issue, the ongoing discussions have led to weekly adjustments in rules & standards. \nWhile I cannot decide for you, I will point out that the long-term health risk of \"messing\" with your A1C is quite probably worse than waiting for the vaccine. As for risk of contracting Covid, you have managed to stay safe for nearly a year \u2013  can you hang on for a few more months?\nSue\n",

They damage fruit trees, nibble on the evergreens, pull up succulents (and drop them because they figure out that they don't taste good), and munch on the mums just as the flowers begin to open. I have a high fence around the vegetable/perennial garden. It's a 5' field fence with 2 rows of barbed wire above. I've put in 10' t stakes \u2013 I have to use a step ladder to reach up with the post driver. Not one of my favorite chores. \nI have fencing around the orchard that I hope to improve on this summer. Fencing cages around individual trees, a climbing rose (a favorite of deer), around bushes and so on. It doesn't enhance the beauty of the place, but it's a necessary evil. I found that they don't like rosa rugosa, iris,daffodils, peonies, Oregon grape, juniper and leave blue fescue alone. Until I moved into deer habitat I always had roses. \nAnyone who thinks that deer are cute, as I used to, doesn't have them bedding down in their yard. \nI got a Gurney's nursery catalog today, and I guess that if I want very many things I might have to order through online nurseries. I'd normally get my vegetable and annual  starts from a greenhouse down the road, and I might give them a call to see what their plans are.

They are small businesses in dire danger of not making it. I was on a conference call last night with Master Gardeners and nursery/garden center people. In addition to already having their plants started, with no idea if they will be able to open their pop-up stands and farmers' market stalls, a lot of small growers raise plants for community groups to sell as fund raisers. In MN and south TX, all of those sales are cancelled, and the growers are stuck with the costs and product. A number of centers in the Twin Cities have already set up, or are exploring, ways to sell on the phone or online, with curbside pickup. Please check with your local businesses for products, even if you pay a few bucks more, otherwise they will not be here for you next year.\nLet me tell you a story \u2013 as Master Gardeners, we work on dozens of school, park and community projects every year. Not once in 18 years has a big box store donated product to us, except stuff that was too sickly or damaged to sell and would otherwise be thrown away. Our local garden centers, on the other hand, work hand-in-hand with us to plan and execute gardens in the community and landscape Habitat for Humanity homes, libraries, housing coops\u2026 Last year alone, 5 local growers in our county donated over $3000 worth of plants to our program/partners and to the local food bank gardens. Another small grower provides us plants, on consignment for our fund-raiser plant sale and accepts unsold plants back without penalty. Yet another, who doesn't have a retail location, raises plants almost exclusively for fund-raisers by non-profits. He told us his product is all planted \u2013 seeds/starts, pots, soil, fertilizer all bought, labor done, and 3 weeks of heat lights paid for, and 80% of the orders are cancelled. Unless he can get paid for his sunk costs by some of the organizations, he will have to close his doors. One of our large growers donates thousands of dollars worth of plants to Habitat for Humanity every year, which are then planted by homeowners with the assistance of the local Master Gardeners.\nHappy gardening everyone \u2013 I hope you can find what you need to raise your vegetables or make your yards beautiful.\nSue\n",

Mother lamented that I would not have a garden until Father reminded her that I was working full time outside of the home and volunteering in the community.  He suggested that I had enough to do without having a garden  I was not supposed to hear that conversation, and I still get a chuckle out of remembering it.\nFrom one place to another there was either no space or no time for gardens, until we bought our house nearly 40 years ago.  Man oh may, did I ever break my back trying to grow edibles in our back yard!  Carrots smaller than pencil nubs, not enough peas or beans for a meal, and weeds that grew faster than the plants we wanted.  After a few years we gave up.  Honestly, I don't regret it.  I think I gardened myself out as a child and have no interest left.  I'm glad so many of you enjoy gardening.  I appreciate watching you toil and the plants go through their cycles with no input from me.\n",

The love comes from the pleasure of watching things grow, seeing things bloom, enjoying the produce from the vegetables and the fruit trees. Sometimes I have to share it with various critters. If I weren't retired, I wouldn't have the time or energy to keep up with everything I've planted over the past 14 years. I'm trying to close my eyes to all of the plants in stores and remind myself that I have what I need/want, and that my goal is to make my property lower maintenance. I only buy seeds for vegetables, onion sets, seed potatoes and tomato and pepper plants.\nRight now I have my riding mower apart to replace the belts, waiting for one of them to get here.\nThis has been a mild spring, so I've been doing jobs that usually can't be done for a month from now. I'll be glad to be ahead of the schedule, going into summer. I'm supposed to be having surgery as soon as the hospital is available for non- emergency surgeries.

I have mounds of them that two years ago were a dozen spindly looking plants. There's another plant, I think called the money tree, that falls into that same group. The purple flowers are so pretty in early summer, then they produce round pods that resemble silver dollars. I have to work to limit the space they think belongs to them. They and the buttons, along with feverfew seem to be duking it out, choking out other perennials. I'd like to get them started in an untended area, without supplementing its water needs. Alfalfa and bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, orange mallow along with a few flowers that I'd have to get up and go to the reference section of our home library to look up their names. I decided a few years ago that I'd leave that space untended rather than keeping it mowed. It's around a quarter acre. I've been planting evergreen trees out there. Blue spruce, Austrian Pine, and another pine whose name I can't remember. Oregon grape is pushing its way through the fence that separates the yard from the untended area. I'd plant some juniper trees, but they can become invasive, and they rob all of the water from anything else close by. There's one at the edge of the backyard that the neighbor's cows like to use as shade.\nSomehow, choke cherry planted itself in the fenced garden, and this year killed two evergreen shrubs and is encroaching on everythin within reach.  It sends out roots from which more chokers keep coming up. It's a challenge to keep it confined to its space, and I don't water it because I don't want to encourage it. I suppose I should borrow a backhoe and pull it out, but if I didn't get every piece of root, it would continue in its quest to take over the world.\nWe had a little rain today, so I didn't get as much time in the yard as I'd planned.

Today I trundled dirt with my wheelbarrow from the pile out at the northwest corner of our place to the new path. I needed to put quite a bit of dirt next to the path to make it level with the lawn. Several years ago I made the path, two pavers wide. Over time the shrub and a bunch of blue fescue clumps had grown and nearly covered the path. So I moved the pavers a bit and pruned the shrub (the name of which is buried somewhere in the back of my brain) and made the path three pavers wide. A lot of work down on my knees.\nAfter moving dirt and some rocks to put next to the path, I weeded my Barnabas garden. Barnabas was my service dog for 7 years, and one night he had a stroke or some other brain event and couldn't walk. Having him put down the next morning was a really distressing job. At the vet's office they have a quiet room, and I sat next to him and cried for an hour. One of our neighbors came over with his bobcat and dug a big grave for Barnabas. I planted an orange wild rose, along with several other things, to mark his new home.\nI put the Barnabas garden next to the fence, which may not have been the best place. Our neighbors have their field in pasture grass, with 2 or 3 cuttings a year, and their grass makes its way to our side of the fence, so it's an ongoing chore keeping the fence line clean.

So he was one of our rescue dogs. He became my service dog after some training, much more than a pet. He was very well behaved. The relationship between a handler and his service animal is even closer than a pet. The evening Barnabas had the stroke I took him to an emergency vet that's open 24/7, then went back home and spent a sleepless night with him. In the morning I took him to our local vet and sat in the back seat with him, and held him while she injected the medication. I felt him finally relax, then stop breathing.\nWe lived for 14 years in Albany, Oregon, on the frontage road next to I 5. Over the course of those years, we saw a huge difference in the traffic flow. For a long time, we knew when it was 11 p.m.because the freeway emptied and it became quiet. But the last several years it changed. Traffic continued through the night. We got used to the noise.

I planted them in several places around the yard, and they're early bloomers, and give me a sense of anticipation for all the other colors of iris here and there in various flower beds.

Lots of places in Oregon also don't allow gaiters or handkerchief \"masks.\"  Our small town of 8,000 (which balloons to over 50,000 most weekends due to tourists) has only had two outbreaks: the first was a family of four where the father brought Covid home from a seafood processing plant; family was quarantined and no one else got Covid from them. Second was five motel workers who caught Covid from guests after an extremely nice (read: busy) weekend in August; again, all five were quarantined \u2013no spread whatsoever. There have been huge spreader events due to people renting vacation rental houses for a weekend or week: they're so expensive (just the cleaning fee starts at $200) that most renters invite lots of friends. It's common to see 6 to 8 or more vehicles outside a VRD (vacation rental). One single week-long rental resulted in over 200 people contracting Covid, thankfully, none of them here. The single person who infected others wasn't really sick until after he got home and had infected fellow workers. There were eight separate households represented in that little gathering at the coast. In spite of the danger, we still see multiple cars outside VRDs most weekends. \u2026some people's kids\u2026\n",

But, it is unknown what causes the risks and how much risk there actually is. To answer your question, vaccines have shown that they aren't contraindicated for people who take epilepsy medications. \nMayo has some excellent recommendations to prepare you for your vaccine. Mayo states that it's important to make a plan in case you do have a seizure. My next-door neighbor has very frequent, daily seizures and I believe that he is planning on getting his.\nhttps://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-tips-for-people-with-neurologic-issues-such-as-epilepsy-and-seizure-disorders/\nhttps://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/daily-life/safety/coronavirus-covid-19#\nIt's always a good idea to discuss all new medications/vaccines with your doctors.

One side effect I can think of is if someone had a fever after the injection it could cause a seizure depending on fever or illness if that\u2019s a trigger.

Now that you can rule out an underlying ailment, you can take steps to help get moving. Our fear often holds us back and we start thinking the worst!  Were you given any exercises to increase your core strength? Did he suggest any physical therapy which could help restore your muscle movement and help you feel more stable? A suggestion is to speak with your primary care physician and see if he could refer you for PT.  There are simple exercises you can do at home. Our core muscles are key to balance, stability and back strength. \nI experienced this myself a year ago when undergoing cancer treatments. Five weeks in bed with little exercise left my muscles and core weakened. At 65, for the first time I understood what it meant to feel frail.  It was very disheartening. Walking helped but it did little to restore my balance and shed that frailty. After mentioning this to my oncologist, he arranged for Physical Therapy. My therapist gave me some very simple exercises to restore my balance and core muscles. Wow, I could feel the difference within a week\u2019s time.  After my muscles strengthened and my balance was restore it made a world of difference!  *The one exercise I was told not to do by my PT, is the abdominal crunch. She said older people can do more harm than good.  \nThis pandemic does nothing to help with our isolation! Especially this time of the year when it\u2019s easy to get cabin fever!

It works well for us, but in your case, would it be possible to call in the \"Merry Maids\" or something at least every 2 weeks or so to get down with the deeper cleaning issues? \nMy heart goes out to you in these difficult times. Hopefully you will be in a better situation after getting the vaccine. Best, Hank\n",

Fortunately we have access to a limited supply of masks, and we're careful to hang them to decontaminate naturally between uses.

News reported yesterday that following both Covid vaccs, a man tested positive for the virus.  Is the general public not hearing the same national and public health reports news reported coast to coast?  \nI've read that not all N95 masks are created equally.  I can't buy them here locally so if you find a reputable ordering source would you please share the link here?   Almost a fluke that I received my 1st Moderna shot and am scheduled for the second the first week in Feb.

Circumstances allowed us to get a few more, and we are carefully using them as needed. We have asked for a few more, and we shall see.\nIn the meantime, I will say that the double masks are very nearly as effective if you make sure there are no gaps around the edges. \nThat said, I am looking for an on-line source for certified masks, and will share once I find one.\nPlease remember, when you hear stories of Covid after vaccine, millions of doses have been distributed, and only a handful of post-vaccine infections have been reported. That is what 94-95% effective means \u2013 there will still be a few cases. Compared to the flu vaccine (40-60%) or Shingrix (80%) that's stellar. And remember, they never report the details, the person could have had a condition making it more difficult to make antibodies.\n@merpreb \u2013 N95 masks vary in comfort for longer term wear \u2013 some are nearly suffocating, the 3M ones (rare as hens' teeth) are very tolerable to me. Certified KN95 masks (NIOSH or OSHA or EU) are better, but you have to be more careful fitting them to your face for effectiveness. A couple of clues for anyone looking at N95 masks \u2013 the elastic always goes over the head, never around the ears. And it is not stapled to the mask because that pierces the protective fiber, though it may be stapled to the flange around the very edge, where the seal is.\nSue\n",

There were pins and needles pain and the prickly feeling, but there were no lesions or rash to indicate a recurrence of Shingles.  It was all on the right side (like it was in September).  My neurologist suggested that since the virus that causes Shingles stays dormant in your body, the vaccination probably triggered the pain.

I like the way they look, vanity is an important component of this whole mask thing, eh? \u2026\u2026.. but also got them because they are 3 layers\u2026..one soft cotton on the inside against the skin, another that is a pocket in which you can add a filter \u2013 some recommended using a coffee filter if one didn't have a made to wear filter, and the outside is an antibacterial fabric. It's warm in hot weather and can be challenging to breath at times, but I'm thinking it's actually a pretty good mask.\nI recently bought a couple from the Mayo online store that came w/filters if you chose to use one. I'm adding filters to my masks at this time due to the variants coming our way. Folks from Brazil and other South American, Central American, Mediterranian countries, regularly arrive in Miami Airport. So, I've been and am aware we may well have early exposure to variants. I'm personally concerned about the Amazon variants and the danger they may present to us. Which I also see as a real concern re our southern border, Texas, my fiesty76 friend.\nSo, whether this is logical or medically sound thinking or not, I have no idea, but I think adding this extra layer of precaution may be wise for me.\nI welcome any advice or comments. Also, with this extra precaution, I do feel better. Dr. Fauci is right\u2026.wearing masks and now double masking is perhaps a good thing psychologically whether it actually helps medically or not.\nThis thread is so helpful. Thank you all for your thoughts and insights. You've helped me think it through and make my plans.\nStay safe. We will get through this. And we are now and will be much stronger for the experiences. There is actually something calming about this process of facing a pandemic and our mortality with support from so many others provided by these groups.

Check to make sure that they say NIOSH approved because MANY of the N95 and KN95 masks for sale right now are not. This means either no testing was done, or worse yet, they failed I believe. The 3M 142-8210 plus N95 is for diseases. I'm not sure if the carpentry mask will work, despite the fact that it traps fine particles. Sanding and human droplets may need 2 different filters.\n",

I looked it up and it is NIOSH approved and meets FDA surgical respirator standards \u2013 see my remark below.\nAll N95 masks are all made to the same standard. The difference between \"industrial\" respirators and medical ones is the breathing valve in most industrial masks, making them easier to breathe in. Unfortunately, the valve can let infectious droplets out. NIOSH approval is the key \u2013 it means more than one sample has been tested by an independent lab and complies with the standards. \nHOW TO TELL IF AN SPECIFIC N95 MASK IS NIOSH APPROVED:\nHere is a link to a list of NIOSH approved masks: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/N95list1sect2-m.html\nThe list is very long, but at the bottom of the first page is an alphabet so you can skip to what you want.

The recipes used are traditional to the Slovenes and very similar to what my father-in-law and his cousin made for us. They also have good smoked pork chops, but my husband does our own, and really good brats, but we got our favorites from the Farmers' Market this summer and stocked up well. And they don't put enough garlic in the Polish sausage, so I get those from my \"hometown\" sausage maker here in Minneapolis \u2013 guys I grew up with, now training the 4th generation. \nA favorite winter meal at our house is baked sausage, boiled potatoes and sour cucumbers with onions \u2013 pretty typical old-country comfort food.\nWe also stopped at Cane Lake Candy in Virginia for the dark chocolate \"Hot air\" candy and took a drive through my husband's hometown. Normally we would have stopped at a local bar there to meet with his cousins or classmates, but\u2026 And we would have hit one of the L&M Supply stores, but not this time either.\nWe tried to finish the day with a drive through the Bentleyville lights, but the line was over a mile long at 4:40, with bumper-to-bumper traffic heading in from 35 and from Superior \u2013 and Tuesday is supposed to be the \"least busy\".

    "content": "We are all anxious to get both doses of our vaccines and to be able to resume our lives. In the past year, it\u2019s astonishing to think that our medical professionals, scientists, and researchers have done absolutely amazing things! Almost immediately, researchers around the world were redirected from ongoing projects to Covid-19 projects. They isolated and gene-sequenced the virus with unprecedented speed. They have figured out how to manage the worst stages of the disease, with medications old and new, as well as basic medical care practices and many modifications of standard care. They have found ways we can safeguard ourselves and each other with masks, frequent handwashing, social distancing, isolation & quarantine. Most astonishing of all, multiple successful vaccines were developed and brought to market in less than 8 months! This is a task that usually takes at least 4 years \u2013 remember it took 23 years to develop the first polio vaccine. Enough vaccines need to be manufactured to cover two doses for about 333 million people in the US alone. That\u2019s 666 million doses, distributed on time and safely. This is a colossal undertaking. And as we see now distribution is not perfect.

I believe it will be like cancer and HIV, over time it will be better understood.\nThey may understand over time how often multi-strain infection occurs, but as with H1N1, H1N2, H2N2\u2026 in influenza, it will be years before they reach any conclusions.

With the new variant, this figure is thought to rise to 13 or 14 deaths per thousand \u2013 an increase in mortality of about 30%.\" That comparison implies to me that you have a group of people infected ONLY with the original strain on the one hand, and another group infected ONLY with the new variant, on the other. Now: is that possible? I would expect that it would be more likely that people have combinations of strains. \nThey can determine which variants are present in a certain individual, but how would they determine the proportions of each variant? Maybe that is why Sir Vallance added that there was \u201ca lot of uncertainty around these numbers\u201d.\nRegards,\nArmando\n",

        "content": "UPDATES on VACCINES\nWARNING: Yesterday CNN reported that 2 people in the UK who had \"significant allergy responses\" in the past (perhaps uses an epi-pen for something) had reactions. Therefor, It is inadvisable to have the vaccines if you have significant allergies or use an epi-pen. BUT, please check with your doctor before you make this decision.\nWHAT THE VACCINE ASKS OF YOUR BODY: Only a portion of the virus's genetic code that has genetic instructions has been used to make the vaccines. It tells the person's cells to make the antigen (any substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies against it.) which more closely mimics a natural infection. In the case of coronaviruses, the antigen is the surface spike, a protein the virus uses to bind and fuse with human cells. The vaccine will teach our bodies to recognize this antigen (spike) so that if we come into contact with it our bodies will react to it. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving them the protein\u2014you\u2019re giving them the genetic material that then instructs them how to make that spike protein, to which they make an antibody response that hopefully is protective,\u201d University of Pennsylvania vaccinology professor Paul Offit, MD, explained in a JAMA\ufeff livestream in June. \"\nMASKS AND VACCINES: Pfizer and Moderna trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with Covid-19. That means that there is still the  possibility that some vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms, and could still transmit the virus \u2014 especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks. We already know that people can be re-infected with COVID-19. So a vaccine is advised for people who have had COVID-19 already, but with the advice of you own doctor. DO NOT STOP and of the safety protocols, masks, social distancing, hand washing and being outside. Stay home if possible.\nSYMPTOMS: Since the vaccine teaches out own bodies to react to COVID-19 so that it will protect us the reaction will usually be similar to that of a mild case of the virus. This means a low fever, sore arm (the needle is long to penetrate deeply into the muscle, ouch!), aches and pains, headaches for up to 36 hours or less. IF your symptoms are severe contact your doctor.\nHas anyone had the vaccine yet, even in trials? Will you share your reactions?\n",

This is a serious decision that we will all have to make (unless you have been advised against having it). If there is any hope that the vaccine will work 70% of the population, (Dr. G. Poland), need to be inoculated in order for us to achieve a heard immunity result. We won't get this result, which is necessary to stop COVID-19 unless this happens. \nI have to keep in mind that COVID-19 vaccines have gone through each and every step as all our other vaccines have, to assure safety, that no corners were cut. The reason that the vaccine was so fast to become commercially available was that it showed so much efficacy early on. There is also no evidence that it causes chronic illnesses or cancers or genetic alterations right now, or even COVID-19. Down the line, if necessary, adjustments will be made to accommodate more people who were not part of the testing population. We've had to adjust dosages in other vaccines or add boosters in the past and this will also happen if need be. \nI trust science.

She is a phone triage and ER nurse for a large health system who studies the rule changes, often interprets them for her own coworkers. \nThe doctors are not making this up, although some may not yet understand the new rules completely. Here's the deal, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a whole bunch of new regulations. These came out of findings that a lot of doctors were routinely renewing prescriptions for patients whom they had not actually seen or examined in years (yep \u2013 years.)\nThese include:\nMandatory in person visits annually. A telehealth visit counts the same as in person, except labs still need to be drawn per new regs.\nMandatory lab draws for certain medications. Cholesterol meds every 6 months, some BP meds every 3 months, other meds may have their own requirements.\nTo refill any medication for blood pressure, or any that may affect blood pressure, they must have a record of an in-office blood pressure check within a specific time frame. If you have had a non-illness, non-emergency visit within your system, your PCP can use that reading. \nWhat does this mean for you? You may be required to get labs drawn for certain meds, even though it wasn't required before. An annoyance for sure, but as we all know, drugs long thought \"safe\" can cause problems over time. You may need to go in, at least once or twice a year for a BP check. According to my daughter, this can be just a nurse visit, or when you go for labs or a vaccine.\nAs with all new rules, there is going to be a HUGE learning curve for doctors, their staffs, the insurance companies and all of us. I am going to ask the Connect moderators to see if we can get Mayo to make us an explanatory video, but keep in mind that each PCP, each health system, and each insurance company will be interpreting these rules their own way!\nSue\n",

Now, the Department of Health is trying to find out if they need to hold back vaccine to assure timely second doses or if they can safely distribute all they have on hand. They expect to be able to make an announcement later this week.\nAll of this is, of course, complicated by the change in administration this week, and that fact that a lot of the vaccine is manufactured outside the US. \nI know it is HARD, but we must all continue to practice the CDC Guidelines to mask, distance, wash hands and quarantine until it is our turn.\nStay Safe!\nSue\n",

On symptom-day 3 I started having about 3 fevers (100.0-100.9) daily that would stay above 99.0 with the use of Tylenol. I started to have insomnia at that time, twisting/turning in bed with disrupted sleep the whole night, and I would have the same dream over and over as I drifted into a light sleep. I dreaded the thought of sleep during the day because I knew what was coming. I started a cough that worsened. On 12/13 I went to the ER because I was losing my breath with coughing and started having shortness of breath. I was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to the hospital. Treated with IV antibiotics, IV steroids & injectable blood thinner. I was sent home the next day on oral antibiotics & a steroid (that probably added to the insomnia). I also started home oxygen therapy at 3 liters & piggybacked it into my CPAP hose at bedtime. I continued to wake 3 times a night (waking shortly after midnight, around 0300, & 0500). Insomnia continued until 1/02/21. By then it had tapered to 2 x a night for a week, then 1 time a night for a week.\nAfter being absent from work for a month I returned on 1/04/21 starting at 4 hrs a day. That night I started waking up 3 x a night, again. I started a Rx generic sleep-med that knocked me out so I stopped. It would make me sleep all night but I couldn't get up to go to work. Now, I will start the brand name version 1/13 (fingers crossed that it works). When I awaken throughout the night I also have a hard time going back to sleep. I'm not exactly sure how many hours of sleep I get a night. I didn't notice a difference in my sleep pattern when taking 9mg of Melatonin, so I stopped that a while back.\nFrom the beginning I made sure that I was well hydrated with water. I had a decreased appetite, and a loss of half of my taste, but a heightened taste of salt of anything made with added salt (cheese, peanut butter, etc). I lost 5 lb in 18 days because I also couldn't eat very much due to a fuller stomach pushing against my diaphragm and not letting my lungs expand, causing shortness of breath. Fruit tasted best so I had fresh fruit & my husband made me smoothies. I now eat 2 meals and 2 snacks a day.\nI am also experiencing Covid19 Brain Fog. I have trouble finding words during a conversation, a hard time remembering computer passwords and performing computer tasks, a little trouble staying focused, and get a little overwhelmed with multi-tasking. My employer is working closely with me to make sure I am not getting overworked so I don't have a relapse with my breathing. I work 4-6 hrs a day depending on my stamina.\nI do feel that I am progressing and have noticed mini-milestones on 12/18, 12/23, 1/02/21. On 12/23 I stopped wearing oxygen 24 hrs a day. I still take a shower with oxygen at 1.5 liters, and use 02 with my CPAP at 1.5 L. My oxygen saturation levels on my finger now range 93-95% without oxygen; but if I exert myself too much I get short of breath and have put on oxygen for relief . 02 saturations will drop to 90-92. I removethe 02 once it is resolved. \nIf you have any questions pertaining my story please feel free to ask. I am learning more about my condition and living with the after-effects of Covid19, which I am praying will subside with time. \nK Patterson\n",

By this, I mean that every tester swabs differently and each clinic or hospital has different methods. The results of your \"swab\" as indeterminate might have just been a poor tester. Some people don't go deep enough into your nose. An indeterminate result means that the lab cannot tell for sure if you have COVID-19 (coronavirus) or not. Sometimes the lab will be unable to get any result when they test your sample. This is called an invalid or inhibitory result.\nIf you had the test done because you had symptoms then I would isolate your self and get re-tested. Ask your PCP how long you need to wait before you are re-tested. \nIf you have symptoms and have symptoms make sure that you monitor your O2 levels and temperature regularly. A Pulse Oximeter is easy to use and can be purchased at any pharmacy. Treat your symptoms so that you are as comfortable as possible.  \nIf you have no symptoms then find out when you can get re-tested and go from there. Best of luck.

I have been thinking of gifting our household a new kitten, but we didn't fare too well with a rescue we adopted Feb 2019. Our first cat, a Burmese mix, took an instant dislike to 3 Speed [she had three legs] and declared war. Not a very happy household, and we had to rehome her. So, I watch cute kitten videos now, glaring at our Tessie Belle and tell her \"this could be us if you'd allow it!\"\nWe did help out a family who recently lost everything. While getting out in public is a challenge this year, my husband and I had such fun lending a hand. It is very soul-satisfying to be able to do this. Bless their hearts, the two teenagers only wanted some clothes.\nA fun thing to think about is how much more social we will be next year, as a nation. There was an \"Unofficial Just Some People With Lights on Their Vehicles\" parade in town Saturday night, and we will do that next year [gosh, a whole year to think up something crazy!]. I am not in to techy stuff, so your idea of getting a Siri was just right for you. Does she argue her points, and present a challenge? My stepson got me a new wind spinner for the front yard, while I made TV watching lap blankets customized for each of his family. That was fun to rootle through fabric stash and have each one different!\nI invite @fiesty76 @imallears @jakedduck1 @sueinmn @rosemarya to clue us in what fun things they may be gifting or receiving?\nGinger\n",

And my daughter requested a new apron, so I found special fabric and made her a reversible one.\nWe don't gift our little guys with a lot of toys but they are really into pretend cooking so I created a set of play dishes pots and pans supplemented with small real spatulas and the like. All is being delivered in two totes with pretend burners on top. Auntie added play food and I made them aprons.\nThe adult kids are getting requested special cookware.\nGifts will be exchanged in person Dec 24th during a short visit then we'll dine separately. At 10pm we will walk to an outdoor candlelight service at a neighborhood church as we cannot imagine Christmas Eve without, and our church is still only virtual. \nOur celebration on the 25th will be a project thought up and tested by Auntie and the big boy.  We will assemble Charcuterie Houses \u2013 like gingerbread houses made of meats, cheeses and raw veggies, hald in place by cream cheese. We will be masked while we do it then take them home and eat \"together\" on Zoom.\nWe usually entertain at least 2-3 dozen family members on Christmas day.  We took that money and donated to a nearby family whose earners were all unemployed since April, to allow them to have a festive meal and maybe a few small gifts. \nWe have already begun making calls to friends and family members we won't be able to see.

Like you, I'm not tech savvy either and still haven't figured out what to ask or do with the Alexa Echo Show gifted by my daughter!  \nGood for you & hubby for helping the family who lost everything! And how humbling and touching that the teenagers only requested clothes.  I truly find that the very best of giving and receiving for me at any holiday is doing something thoughtful for others who may be struggling, either with the added loneliness or because of other circumstances.\nA neighbor friend called on X-mas Eve to tell me her partner had just been hospitalized..thankfully not Covid but severe strep throat.  All of her family live in Scotland and no remaining relatives for our hospitalized friend.  When asked if she'd be doing a Zoom with her sister, she said that she'd declined even though it was her Birthday\u2026Oh, wow!  Double calamity\u2026.X-mas alone and on her birthday to boot!  I quickly put together a b.d. and X-mas pkg and then thought to e-mail her some pics of me taken for fun the day before.\nLuckily my hair is thick and grows fast.  The usual 3 1/2 week haircuts are currently delayed now by 2 1/2 mos.  First early (and only if I'm lucky!) morning glance in the mirror reveals a cross between the flying nun head gear and England's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson except mine is curly.  One has to tout all advantages, multiple cow licks and all, yes???\nOn a whim and inspired by my even more unusually astonishing early morning appearance on the 23rd, I teased my locks it a bit more before donning red X-mas sweater and adding every piece of X-mas jewelry in the house\u2026jingle bell earrings, broaches, necklaces, the works\u2026Then in honor of the occasion and Because I'd not used a speck of artifical beauty since early March, I added the out of lines lipstick, rounds of clown blush, up-to-brows, eyeliner and mascara.  Truly a sight to behold!  \nCalled a friend and asked if she'd take a few pics of me all decked out; she did and e-mailed photos to my family and some friends..Wearing X-mas socks for \"mittens\"; with numerous face masks dangling from wrists and holding a sign:  Ho! Ho! Ho!  Merry X-Mas 2020, it brought some hilarious responses with a few verging on impertinence\u2026no respect for the close-up wrinkles and well earned silvers in the hair..what can I say???    So I e-mailed those to both neighbor friends as well.\nI am a big believer in self-rewards throughout the year\u2026great motivation to get those dratted tasks done\u2026it works for me!  And having spent many holidays celebrating alone, I've become quite proficient at planning ahead for those special days with favorites for meals and sometimes the table cloth, candles and good china.  Also small indulgences like fragrantly scented, candle lit soaky baths, a Bloody Mary to start the day, doing a totally nothing constructive day, turning off the phone for a nap with no guilt, and binging on whatever book or tv entertainment calls my name.  \nAlways feel perfectly \"justified\" on \"special days\" in also gifting myself with some small extravagance\u2026a recent b.d. self-gift was subscription to Netflix\u2026Yes!  \nAnother treat was steering clear of media and computer/e-mail posts/\"news\" for several days. Why subject self needlessly to unhappy that you can avoid or do nothing to rectify is my thinking.  and no regrets.\nThis holiday, a \"goodie\" order for family from a cheese/meat/confection catalog offered a \"thank you for the order\" choice of either cheese or butter toffee\u2026naturally, I went with the toffee; one can purchase cheese any ole' day, right???  Oh, That was a Good choice!!\nOne thing is certain regardless of what or how or if we celebrate the holidays this year and that is that everyone of us can be hopeful for a much, much better 2021 ahead.  Best to all! \n",

I look forward to their words of comfort each time it arrives in my inbox. This article really hit home for me this week. It's a bit of a read, but worth it!\n*************\nA Quiet + Contemplative New Year's Eve\n\u200d\n\u201cHow we spend our days is how we spend our lives.\u201d\n~Annie Dillard\n\"It doesn\u2019t have to be\nthe blue iris, it could be\nweeds in a vacant lot, or a few\nsmall stones; just\npay attention, then patch\na few words together and don\u2019t try\nto make them elaborate, this isn\u2019t\na contest but the doorway\ninto thanks, and a silence in which\nanother voice may speak.\"\n~Mary Oliver\nNew Year's Eve 2014\u2026It was a cold, snowy day in the high, pine forested mountains of Arizona. I was visiting a dear friend at her cabin and we had been housebound for days. Our only entertainments were playing the piano + guitar, singing, drawing, loud enthusiastic midnight dancing, and creating time-consuming, elaborate vegetarian meals. Although we were isolated, it was a magical time, full of poetry and music and all the things I love about life.\nI am reminded of this time every year, because this visit was the last time I got to spend with my friend before she passed away unexpectedly at age 23\u2013and I am constantly learning how precious she was to me and how much her friendship added and continues to add to my life. What was once loss has transformed into an endlessly deep well of love and inspiration\u2026There is always more love and more energy that comes from our friendship and the lessons I am continually learning (re-learning?) because of it.\nShe introduced me to a New Year's tradition which I would like to share with you: on New Year's Eve we each took a large piece of paper from an oversized sketchbook, and whatever colored markers we could lay our hands on. We each cast our minds back over the events of the past year, and contemplated what we'd learned, what we had gained and lost, what we dreamed and wished and hoped for in the coming year. Then, we each wrote a letter to our future self, to be opened the following New Year's Eve.\nIn the letter, you can write whatever you want. Maybe you will tell yourself about all the challenges you overcame in the past few months, or an unexpected joy you experienced. Maybe you will describe this year in 3 words, or perhaps you will focus on the future and everything you hope for in the year to come. When you have written your letter and sealed it, put it away somewhere safe. Next year, before you write another letter, you can read the old one and see how far you've come, the things that have changed in your life, and the ways you've grown and changed.\nEvery time I write my New Year's letter I remember how important it is to be awake, to pay attention to life as it slips by\u2013To spend my time and energy trying to focus and appreciate all that I have, and gather all the inspiration and tools that can help me do so. I invite you to join me in this tradition taught to me by someone whose idealistic and hopeful nature, brilliant artistic and musical mind, and incredible creative dancing fire continue to inspire me every day.\nNew Years' blessings\nEWF\n\u200dOn a practical note, it can help to have some questions to start out with. Even if you only answer one or two, it is a good way to get the creative juices flowing. My friend always asked fascinating, fruitful questions that could bring even the shyest strangers out of their shells.

I, too, was immediately and deeply struck by the author's Paradise Found passage on the sudden loss of her friend.\nOne of my two very closest friends died unexpectedly in her sleep on 12/21 three years ago.  She was scheduled for a pacemaker the first week in the new year but otherwise in fine health.  We were slated for our annual X-mas lunch together the following day.  Like your brother, she died in her sleep and was discovered by her husband who had been fighting a long, courageous battle with cancer.  The shock for all who knew and loved my friend took a very long while to come to grips with.  \nLike you, I came to view her sudden death as a mercy in that she did not experience the prolonged and valiant effort my very closest friend experienced with her death this past June 23rd.  Witnessing this friend's positive attitude despite her increasing complications and suffering proved almost unbearable at times.  Both brought lasting value in incredible ways to my life over the 30+ yrs of our friendships.  Both emphasized the good in others and always viewed the glass \"half full\".  \nSomething our school principal said at a beginning of the year teachers' inservice has stayed with me since 1975 and relates to what you wrote about the \"last time\".  \"Always greet someone with a smile and kind hello because you never know what has just happened in their lives\".  His emphasis was on what might have happened before a child got to school on a given day but it can apply to everyone.\nNone can predict what tomorrow will bring so it behooves us all to let those most dear know how much they are loved and appreciated while we still can.\n",

If I had enough money until the next income date, I was grateful.  If I had a functioning vehicle, I was grateful.  If I could buy new clothes from the clearance rack, I was grateful that it wasn't from the thrift shop.  If we were able to have family time each day, I was grateful.  These may seem like such small, inconsequential things, but some days we did not have some of those things.  And that made it harder.  So, I decided to be grateful for what we did have.  Sometimes all we had was each other.  Some days that was not assured, as I had a baby that spend 9 months of the first year in the hospital and 6 months of the second year in the hospital.  That child was resuscitated multiple times and is now 40 years old.  Just for today I am grateful . . . (fill in the blank for yourself).\n",

        "content": "@merpreb and @nannette1941,  Darn!  Those days of being in a funk when we feel angry and depressed are really a bear aren't they!  \nAfter the many numerous good wishes for a Happy New Year followed by comments of \"hope for how much better the new year will be..(and I am guilty of those for sure!), I hit a funky bomb day with the thoughts of \"what if it isn't a happier, saner, healthier year?  After all, \"things can always get worse!\", right?   Oh, my word\u2026that is a sure trademark of \"stinkin' thinkin\" but it does happen and perhaps to most of us from time to time.\nNot @nannette1941, but Merry, your question got me thinking of what I've done or do to help me step out of the blues when they hit.  One of the best is to leave the house and head for a park or even head for a large pkg lot and just watch people going in and out\u2026any season will work.  \nAnother, weather permitting, is going into my yard and doing something physical to my landscape.  Just turning the compost pile or ideas for adding or deleting plants for the next season or pulling weeds helps because I can lose myself there and it removes my focus on what's troubling and redirects me to a more constructive train of thought.  \nLong before I started jotting down gratitudes each morning and night before bed during the pandemic, I used to make myself sit and write as fast as possible as many gratitudes as I could come up with.  \nMerry, I agree that reaching out to someone else is another great antidote.  When I'm having a really down day though, I don't want to call another but I've sometimes made myself make a call anyway\u2026not to share my own blues but to check on what is happening with them..just hearing another voice and what is shared can improve my spirits.  \nWhatever I can come up with that will redirect my focus away from me and onto something else can make a difference.  Physically \"doing\" rather than sitting and \"mulling\" works best for me.\nHowever, yesterday was one of those days when I was feeling angry at the \"state of the world\".  Could not work up interest in anything in the yard so drove over to the local wildflower park. Usually there are a few others there walking which allows for a wave or \"hi\" but I had the small park all to myself and though it felt strange not to see another, I did push to walk farther and longer than usual.  Driving away I saw a family of four walking in the park.  Timing is everything but I did have my own private park for awhile, yes?\nDecided that the car could really use a professional bath but too many others had the same idea and my patience wasn't up to the wait. Once home, I grabbed the spray and cleaned all the windows.  That didn't take long but doing that one small thing improved my outlook.  Had been \"looking at\" the basket of yarn, needles and instr. manuals sitting on my breakfast bar for days to encourage my attempt to re-teach and resume knitting for the new year.  Last evening, I actually opened the manual and while I wasn't completely successful with the beginning steps, I was surprised that instead of being frustrated at the failed attempt, I would never have even tried that yesterday given my mood earlier in the day.  Everything is relative yes?  \nJust a ramble here and not expecting responses but glad to have a place to share and would be interested in hearing what others do and find helpful when a down day happens?      \n",

They were 50 and 40 when I was born so I was still in HS when my father died and in my 20s when my mother did.  Since this was typical for her whole family I just figured I too would die when I was in my 60s.  Surprise, surprise, I'm still here, as is my sister who is 3 years older than I am.  My brothers are both gone but they made it into their 70s too.  \n@becsbuddy   Thanks, Becky.  These sound delicious.  I have a recipe for coconut snowballs that is good too, using white chocolate.  We had a caterer once for a large event here and that one of the desserts he brought.  I loved them so he gave me the recipe, but these sound even easier!\n@fiesty76  Thank you for your condolences.\nI also believe that we have to remember to treat each person well, we don't know what they are going through or have been through that day.\nI was walking up the aisle in a drugstore once and a man who passed me said \"you could at least smile\" \u2013 this was out of the blue.  I didn't know him, he was a well-dressed man, but who was he to say that to me?  He had no idea why I might not have looked happy. \n@Erinmfs  California is a beautiful state but it sure does have its drawbacks. My son lived there from 2004 until 2018 and now lives in Denver.  For him, it was the high cost of owning property but I think he is happy being in Denver, fewer natural disasters there, plus he is an avid skier, and his wife is an avid snowboarder.   \n@merpreb @nannette1941   I think these days many of us are in a funk, on some days.   I sure know I am.  I think we can take anything for a certain amount of time but this has gone on for way too long. I actually predicted at the very beginning that it would last for a very long time, and wondered if I would ever see my son in Denver again since seeing him requires a flight and I do not want him taking the risk of flying here.  We will see how the vaccine helps but so many are not planning to take it that we will never reach \"community immunity\" and for us who are on immunosuppressants that's a problem since even if/when our transplant teams say yes to us taking it, it will be less effective on us.  I have read it will be about 60% effective so I suspect I will be wearing a mask for the remainder of my life.   \nWhen I find myself in a funk though about staying home and going literally nowhere except for isolated walks, I try to remind myself of what people over the years have endured.  I have read a number of books about the Jewish experience during WW2 and how horrible that must have been.  That helps me to realize that I live in a nice home, we have plenty of food to eat, and so far my husband and I are both doing OK, healthwise.\nJK\n",

If she Tests positive does that extend my quarantine since I will be in close contact with her? Also since testing positive when will I be able to get the vaccine? I have the opportunity through both of my jobs being a healthcare worker and being a teacher. Also if my boyfriend and I have both tested positive can we quarantine together even tho we have different symptoms or do we risk giving each other our symptoms?",

We are not medical professionals, so we cannot dispense medical advice.\nHere is what guidelines say about Covid-19 positive family/household members: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html\nSince you are all testing positive and in the same household, it is permissible to isolate together. The symptoms you get depend on how your body reacts to the virus, not the symptoms of others around you who also have it.\nBUT you must protect anyone else in the household from all of you who are positive, and they must quarantine for a full 14 days from the date of the last person in your home who does test positive (even if they test negative right now.) That means no school, work, daycare, shopping, socializing\u2026 And definitely no one else coming into your home. \nYou should also notify anyone who came in contact with you within 2-5 days of testing positive or getting your first symptoms that you have Covid. This includes anyone you visited or visited you, coworkers, daycare, restaurants or similar places you visited\u2026 You can spread Covid before you have symptoms or a positive test.\nAbout the vaccine: Current guidelines limit people receiving the vaccine immediately after a positive Covid-19 test, but since this is a brand new vaccine, guidance changes often. Keep track of the date of your positive test result and the last day of your symptoms, and consult with your provider to determine when you will be eligible for the virus. It will not cure you if you already have the virus, and will only protect individuals from getting the virus roughly 2-4 after receiving the first AND second doses at the recommended intervals.  \nI hope you all weather this without getting seriously ill.\nSue\n",

        "content": "A few weeks ago, I specifically asked my rheumatologist about Prednisone and PMR. Obviously it is a complicated question because PMR is a disease that results from an overly aggressive immune system.  While the trigger is usually unknown, it is known that the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol (often but not always confirmed by blood tests).  Prednisone at higher doses shuts down the adrenals, thereby reducing cortisol and \u201cshutting down\u201d the immune system. One of the reason to taper Prednisone is to gradually bring the adrenal glands back to work. At lower doses, probably 20 mg a day or less, (I found one study done in Europe that confirms that) the adrenals are back working (hopefully) so your immune system should be working normally by the time you wean off it.  At 10 mg a day or less, you clearly are not at higher risk for Covid-19 by reason of Prednisone ingestion. HOWEVER, everyone is different and many of us have other risk factors, particularly age. So all posts encouraging social distancing and hand washing are right on as we don\u2019t want to find out what a combination of Covid-19 and PMR will be like.

I'm 77 now and a high risk if I were to contract COVID-19.  \nI have no medical training or background but I don't think being on prednisone has anything to do with contracting COVID-19 but think it would make getting infected with COVID-19 worse for us.

I have now been on prednisone since December 2019, with dose raised to 10 mg in January.  I am now on 8 mg.  In retrospect, I think I came off prednisone too quickly 2 years ago..  Either I am having a recurrence or it never really went away.  I am going slow this time.  My rheumatologist\u2019s office sent out a notice saying drugs one would need to come off of if you got Covid.  On the list was a dose of prednisone over 20 mg.  So my 8 is well below that.  I have always found it devilishly hard to make the small changes like going from 5 to 4 to 3, etc.  I am taking my time this time, hoping I can get it back in remission.   I think our goal is social distancing and avoiding Covid if we can.  (In my case, it means social distancing from kids and grandkids, sigh). \n",

        "content": "Hi, Verni and welcome. A couple of comments:  PMR is idiopathic, meaning there is no known cause.  There does seem to be some relationship with flu or Shingrix vaccines, and also with stress, but it is hard to know exactly what causes it in individual cases.  Also, I\u2019m afraid PMR doesn\u2019t go away.  If you have the disease, you will always have it.  It\u2019s symptoms can go into remission and usually do with the right dosage of Prednisone or related corticosteroid.  If you\u2019re really lucky, the symptoms won\u2019t come back, but that\u2019s the exception, not the rule. In fact the average time from first symptoms to remission without steroids is 5.9 years, so it\u2019s a long haul disease for most. As far as the vaccine is concerned, the flu and Shingrix vaccines include inactivated or partial snippets of the virus they combat. The Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines approved thus far do not include any of the coronavirus; rather they are \u201cmessenger DNA\u201d vaccines, meaning they are created in a lab to convince our immune system to fight the coronavirus.  At least in theory they pose no risk of giving you COVID-19.  That appears to be borne out by the tens of thousands in the clinical trials and the early reports from over 2 million vaccinations.  In any event, check with your doctor about your situation.  Like John said, i view the risk of COVID greater than the risk of side effects (I have PMR and take 10 mg of Prednisone a day after two flares when i thought i was off the drug) so I will be getting the shot when they get to me.  I encourage everyone to strongly consider getting the vaccine unleaded their doctor feels otherwise.  \n",

I understand you are looking for advice on traveling back home from where you are spending this winter months in order to get the vaccine when you are able to do so. \nI will venture to guess that you are not alone in this decision and many others will be facing the same in the coming weeks and months.  Weighing the risk is a very individual decision full of many factors. The CDC released the following travel recommendations that you might find helpful:\n-Domestic Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic (12/02/2002)\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\nIn addition, I think this is a good example of a question well-suited for your doctor knowing he/she understands your individual health risks most clearly.

        "content": "Hi Jeannette \u2013 In answer to your question about whether the vaccine would prevent Covid if you were exposed during travel, then had the shot the next day.\nImmunity from a vaccine injection is not instantaneous, therefore the answer would be no. The injection activates production of antibodies which must build up in your system. People with weakened immune systems, or older people usually take longer to form the antibodies than young, healthy individuals. With a typical, single-injection vaccine like the flu shot, protection is considered to begin at about 2 weeks, and be fully active at about a month. The Covid vaccines currently approved for use require 2 injections, 2 \u2013 4 weeks apart, so I would believe you should not count on any protection before a second shot.\nMy husband and I are having a similar discussion, as are many of our snowbird friends. Other important considerations, no matter how much we dislike snow and cold\u2026 The warmest places currently seem to have the highest levels of infection and hospital occupancy rates, and the lowest rates of mandated precautions or people voluntarily taking precautions. This increases risk during day-to-day activities. Large numbers of people traveling from many places to the warmth are potentially bringing the virus along. If they do not self-quarantine upon arrival, that means increased risk of exposure. Just as critical, all these factors can mean decreased availability of medical care for any other accident, injury or illness.\nI hope this helps with your decision-making.\nSue\n",

Naturally my thoughts often return to my garden as I plan which plants to use to attract butterflies, bees and birds. \n",

I just noticed we have a lone juvenile gold finch hanging around with the cardinals. And juncos are new here \u2013 we don't see them in summer. Every couple of days, the birds all disappear, and when I go for my walk I hear the eagles calling as they fly near here.\nHere's a fun energy food for your feathered friends:\n1 lb peanut butter, 1/2 lb lard, rendered suet or solid shortening (I use one plain suet cake from the farm supply store), 1 lb coarse cornmeal \u2013 melt together over low heat, let cool until semisoft and spread on a rough log or pine cones. Roll in hulled sunflower seed (optional) for an extra treat. Hang and watch the birds enjoy. If you use pinecones, I suggest hanging them with wire so the squirrels cannot steal them, which they do if you use twine. Store the extra, covered in a cool place and reapply as needed. \nWish I had a picture of the \"feeder logs\" our friend makes (not many rough-barked trees in Texas) \u2013 about 3-4\" diameter & 18-20\" long, shallow one inch divots drilled all over to hold the mixture, eye hook in one end for hanging. We use these in TX to fatten up the migratory birds before they begin the trip northward in Spring, here most seed eaters prefer them to suet.\nI did this project with my grandson last week and we hung the cones from branches they could see out the picture window.\nSue\n",

Although I read all the heartfelt messages that come in, I do it in the evening when my energy is low and it\u2019s harder for me to focus and concentrate to give all of you my input, support and care.  However, everyone, please know I care deeply for all of you and your journeys\u2026..life has many roads we all must travel and there is so much support here!  I thank all of you and am grateful everyday for this space\u2764\ufe0f\nNow, the origin of my username comes from the Ojibwe name for eagle.  I worked with the Leech Lake Band Of Ojibwe for many years and the eagle (migizi) is one of the Seven Grandfather Teachings.  Although I am not of their tribal background or race, gradually they accepted me and gave me so much in terms of compassion, knowledge, and laughter.  I worked in the capacity of mental health, providing therapy to severely emotionally disturbed children and youth in their small community in the school setting, in a Level IV special education program and the Alternative Learning Center.  The kids and their families had so many challenges, yet the love that they shared was unconditional and endless in spite of the depths of grief their community often experienced.  Ok, I guess I\u2019ve rambled enough. As you probably noticed, I loved my job (in spite of intense stress), but had to retire due to Covid this year because my bronchiectasis interfacing with the kids would be too high risk for my health.  Fortunately, I\u2019m now 65 and Medicare is here for me.  But now I grieve for the kids and leaving them without therapy right now\u2026..eventually someone will be hired and then they will have new opportunities.  Though, as I mentioned, they are used to loss and unfortunately, I am another loss to them.  Sorry to make this sound sad\u2026.I also grieve my loss to not be there anymore but my health feels more stable, although my energy level continues to stay somewhat low.  Thanks for asking and Have a wonderful holiday!\n",

A big salute to you for the many years you devoted to also providing \"compassion, knowledge and laughter\" as you worked with the many children whose lives you've touched in the Alternative Learning Center. \nPeople working in the mental health fields have personal attributes that many of us do not possess.  You and they can only be admired for their abilities to work in fields of unique and highly stressful challenges.  I hope realizing that will bring you deep satisfaction and pride. \nThere is an understandable loss and grief when we retire and separate from a profession that is more an avocation than mere career choice.  However, all those whose lives you've enriched and improved will long appreciate your impact on their lives.   Remember that no one can take away our memories of that which was most important to us.  \nFor those of us fortunate enough to have spent our professional lives working in areas that we loved, retiring initially can bring a feeling that we've lost a large part of our identity.   However, I have every confidence that you will find new additional ways to bring meaning to your life and those of others, much as you bring to these forums.  \nI remember giving a shout out too when I became eligible for Medicare in retirement!  What a relief to benefit from that additional health care coverage!   As often as I complain about the numerous shortcomings of our nation's medical providers, I am so grateful to be living in a country in which it took less than a year for scientists to produce the life changing Covid-19 vaccines.  \nWishing you the best as you embark on this new lovely phase of your life called: retirement!\n",

Our ICU's are, and have been at over 95% of capacity for more than a week. Our positivity rate is at 10% and climbing. We each have elevated risks due to health and/or age.\nAs a result, even our small family will change our plan. Unless weather permits a picnic (about a 5% chance here), we will each prepare part of the feast, then exchange offerings at the door of our home and eat separately in our own homes while chatting on Zoom. After dinner we will partake in an outdoor activity together  \u2013 walk, scavenger hunt, etc. If it's raining, we will engage in a toddler-friendly game over Zoom instead.

I had no pain at first, just the itching.  \nBy the time I got to the doctor, there was a lot of lower back pain that felt like I must have lifted something too heavy, but could not think of doing anything like that.  The pain was very intense, like a sunburn inside the body.  The doctor put me on an antiviral med which caused the bumps to disappear but the pain continued and grew from my lower back to my side on the flank area (the ER doc thought I might have appendicitis or a kidney stone).  This sunburn-type of pain was intense.  It took 2 rounds of prednisone and lots of Gabapentin for about 3 weeks before it was bearable.  \nI would definitely not want to repeat that experience.

At 77 yrs, I'm older with several chronic health conditions which made it important to me to quarantine more closely and for longer than many.  I trust our highly reputable infectious disease specialists so when I heard Dr. Fauci say over the weekend that he would take the vaccine when it became available, I trust that I will too.

I am in MN and the Minnesota Department of Health has the following decision tree that we are to use:\n\u2013 MN Department of Health COVID-19 Decision Tree for People in Schools, Youth, and Child Care Programs\nhttps://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/schools/exguide.pdf\nWhen you have a test done and are waiting for results, the general recommendation is that you remain at home in quarantine until your results are in so as not to potentially spread it to others if you do end up testing positive. In addition, since you've been exposed to a known positive case, it is generally recommended you remain at home in quarantine for 7-14 days (depending on state guidelines) from the last time you were with the infected person.  \nHave you notified your employer of your close contact with your spouse testing positive?\n",

I am a transplant recipient and immunocompromised.  I got my test right after he got his positive results and I waited 2 days to get my negative results.\nOur local health department was in contact with us, asked who he had contact with,  and monitored us.  They called daily.   I had to quarantine for 14 days after his positive result.  He had to isolate (separate bedroom, bathroom, avoiding common areas,masking if we were in same area of house, and wiping down every surface.  Our home has a lower level, and he stayed downstairs, except for going to the dining room for a meal that I had prepared for him.  I did not let him in \"my\" safe kitchen!  I lived on the upper level.\nHe was cleared from isolation on day 10 after his symptoms appeared, but had to quarantine (stay home) until I was unquarantined.\nWe were quarantined over the Thanksgiving week, and feel fortunate that we are both back to normal now.\nThe CDC has recently changed the guidelines for quarantine, so check with your state and/or local health department for the current policy where you live.

If you have not isolated yourself from others (quarantined) then you may be exposing them to COVID-19 without realizing it. Here are some basic facts that might interest you about COVID-19 and its testing and why it is important to get tested.\nTesting is one of many precautions in the protocol for COVID-19 and staying safe. There are several reasons to get tested for COVID 19. If you are ill if you are worried that you could expose others, if you have been exposed or if you are hospitalized for something else and have to be admitted are all part of keeping yourself and others safe. Everyone should participate because this is a virus that has no bounds, no special interests, not biases. It's like cancer, anyone can get it. And it can be deadly.\nA test for COVID-19 is only one step along with quarantining, avoiding crowds, using masks, washing hands, and social distancing that will help keep you safe. Nothing is 100% with this virus. If you have had COVID-19 or get it in the future there is still a chance to get it again.\nIf you have minor symptoms or no symptoms but have been exposed you can still pass it on to someone else. So if you have symptoms the prudent thing to do is to get tested, stay home and quarantine and tell your doctor and others who you have been around so that they can be warned.\n",

What alarmed me was that my neighbor is on oxygen 24/7 and has other chronic health issues.  Yet, she wasn't instructed to go be tested.   Three days later, her adult daughter who lives with her experienced symptoms and went for testing which showed her to be positive for the virus.  Both quarantined and apparently had a milder case but the daughter was ill longer.  \nWith compromised lungs and other chronic health conditions that put my neighbor and me at risk, I would have thought the doc would have advised immediate testing for my neighbor?\nOur three hospitals are at capacity for beds and additional staff have come to help.

The good starts to show itself in the most simple of ways when you stretch to list 10 things each day\u2026 like a green light when you are running behind or a smile from a stranger on a day that you needed one.  \nAnyway, please keep us posted if you get any feedback from your sharing of gratitude.  I think we could all use it so much more than ever and the sharing is just as meaningful to the soul as receiving.  \nWho is first on your list to share with?  \n",

Doing that seems to get my day off to a better start and I try to add things so often taken for granted which takes a little thought time.  It seems to help even more before bed as sometimes daily events and news can add additional stress and putting the focus on something I appreciate seems calming.\nMy pulmonologist, cardiologist and pcp and their staffs were the first notes to be mailed.

Thank you for spurring me on to do the same. I left the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville yesterday, after a day of testing and a visit with another marvelous Mayo doctor\u2026left exhausted, physically/mentally/emotionally, and elated with the information he shared. I cared for my mother for over 12 years as she slowly deteriorated with altzheimers. Alone, with no family or other support. This was in 1980-1990's. She died in 2011. Obviously, I've been overly concerned about my cognitive abilities. Yesterday, I was told by the second expert, (1st was last week with Dr. Graff-Radford who treated my mother!)  that there is no indication of cognitive issues! In fact, I'm improving! As I walked to my car, I began to hear the doctor's words. It took me most of the evening to realize 'I'm FREE!'  The next thought was how do I say 'thank you' to all these precious doctors and staff who have brought me back to life over the last 2 years. You have the answer for me. Tomorrow is dedicated to writing individual notes to each doctor and other staff who have guided me through this journey. I first went to neurology for MS diagnosis\u2026no MS, no Parkinson's, no Epilepsy(after 62 years of seizures), no Altzheimer's!!!!, thyroid under control, heart better, anxiety improved, sleep apnea treated\u2026.on and on. Now, I begin to live. Thank you, Fiesty 76! Thank you Mayo and all it has and is offering me. Thank you. ess77\n",

Wonderful!\nFor those of us who have been primary, sole caregivers for a loved one, we can relate to not only the vigilance and other physical, mental and emotional drains from that 24/7 care but oftimes the similar fears and apprehensions that we may also be diagnosed with the same debilitating condition(s).  To be given the AOK that all is well is the best of all possible news!  \nI've told many a nurse and doc that one of the things I appreciate on visits is being able to go down that list of many conditions that we are asked to star if we have and being able to leave most of them unchecked! \nSo glad my post resonated with you and agree that Mayo Clinics and Connect groups are truly exceptional and one-of-a-kind gifts for us all.

We had a similar discussion about acceptance and persuasion in this discussion:\n\u2013 COVID-19 Concerns: How do you help others understand? https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/how-do-you-make-them-understand/\nIn that discussion, I wrote:\nWhen trying to explain the concerns about COVID-19 to someone, even family, it is first important to understand why they may be resisting protective restrictions and evidence published by trusted medical sources. Even facts may not resonate when people are suffering due to financial concerns or they don't (yet) know anyone who has had the virus.\nThis article from Psychology Today sheds some light:\n\u2013 Why Aren't Some People Taking COVID-19 More Seriously? https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psych-unseen/202003/why-arent-some-people-taking-covid-19-more-seriously\nHere's another discussion that may be of interest:\n\u2013 We're told to wear masks. How do we do it safely and properly? https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/masks/\nTo address, your primary question regarding the message on the box of surgical ear loop masks that someone is using as \"proof\" that masks don't help. There is a fundamental flaw in this person's understanding of what the masks can do and why they work only if we all wear them. Ear loop surgical masks and cloth masks do not protect the wearer from getting germs, but rather the mask stops them from spreading their own germs to others. So if we all wear masks, no one is spreading germs beyond their own mask.\nDoes that make sense?\n",

      {
        "content": "@tjdog  I wanted to offer some information about surgical masks.  First, understand that there are legal issues if a manufacturer claims the mask can protect you and stop a virus.  If a person wears a mask and catches COVID-19, the manufacturer could have legal claims against them, so no one can give you a guarantee.  There is variability in masks too because of the material they are made with and probably variation among the same brand of masks.  Last year, I had purchased ear loop masks from 3 M that filter down to .1 micron particles and are rated at filtering out over 95% of particles at that size.  That is the same as HEPA filtration and that can filter out viruses.  There is also variation in the size of different viruses and possibly variation in the size of this novel coronavirus, but the fabric can filter out some of it and multiple layers help filter more.  Surgical masks are not tight against the face, and if you taped that to your face, you would have a better seal and it would filter out a lot more if there was no bypass available.    Masks are rated for particle filtration of .1 microns (PFE) and bacterial filtration (BFE) capability.  Surgical masks are usually tie on styles instead or ear loops because they will be tighter and not fall off during surgery and ear loop masks are more comfortable.   You can always wear a surgical mask and put a fabric mask over it.  I do that with something I bought for sun protection which is like pulling a turtleneck up on your face.  The company that makes these is called BUFF.  I can wash that and keep the disposable mask \"clean.\"  Not clean, because stiff can pass through the BUFF head wear.  Hydrogen peroxide kills the virus and I will spritz the disposable mask with it and let it dry to use another day.  \nHere is a link to 3M product information that explains if you look at the footnotes.  https://imgcdn.mckesson.com/CumulusWeb/Click_and_learn/3M_%20Health_%20Care_%20Surgical_%20Masks_%20and_%20Respirators_Sell_Sheet_2020_5.pdf\nIf you are thinking about home made fabric mask efficiency, denim comes reasonably close to what an N95 mask does for filtration, but it also depends if air is able to bypass around it.  Denim, like N95, is a little hard to breathe in.  I read this when I was looking up information about sewing masks.  Colleen also makes a good point because when everyone wears a mask like they are doing at Mayo, it stops a lot of aerosol and respiratory particle spread from the person wearing the mask, and together that reduces possible exposure to this virus a lot for everyone.  To get into Mayo, you need an appointment and are questioned at the entrance about symptoms and your temperature is scanned.  After that you are given a sticker to wear that shows you were cleared for that day to enter.  I was just at Mayo for medical treatment and I felt safe with all of their precautions that are in place, and because I was having surgery, as routine, I was tested for COVID as a precaution with the swab test and blood test for antibodies.\n",

I was the only customer in the lobby, and I learned that it  was for contact tracing if needed.  After I completed my business, I thanked her for the added protection.

I'm a Heart Transplant Recipient and have been wearing a mask for pretty much 2.5 years while out in public.  It was a requirement by my transplant team to help protect me from not just the Flu but multiple of other viruses and bacteria. I have been doing it even after the original time frame of during flu season mainly because I got used to it.  Well this past year I found out that some close friends I have at Church got pretty ill in the early January time frame and got over it.  Covid as you remember was not even being talked about then.  Well it was in April when my Pastor was due to have a medical procedure and found out then that he had Covid antibodies.  Well I'm pretty happy that I was very diligent in wearing my mask at church and I was the only one but my friends understood and would always let me know if they were feeling under the weather.  So based on that information I was in contact with the virus on a weekly bases and didn't even know it.  I did not catch it.  so Im not saying its proof but maybe it helped.  \nSo at least for me maybe I dodged a bullet. Since based on my history I probably would have been one of those that did not survive..I also do the other recommendations that they now talk about on a regular bases like hand washing,  avoiding others who are sneezing and coughing(6 ft distance) etc.\nI hope that helps\nHave a Blessed Day\nDana\n",

Everytime I would come in he'd asked me how I was doing and if had any of doctors I had seen had any idea what was wrong with me.\nOne night I watched a golf show that had Pro Golfer Jimmy Walker on. Toward the end of the show they asked him about his Lyme disease that he and his wife both had.\nAll of a sudden the Light Bulb went off. I imediately came up to mmy office and started reading about it. Copied off a bunch of articles about it. Went into to see my ortho guy for a shot that week and tookthe articles with me. He just smiled! He said he felt I had Lyme disease but it was out of his field at the hospital.\nHe said the first time I told him my symptoms he knew what it was. He also knew that the way they intially treated me with a small dose of antibiotics would cover it up. It would not show up on the blood test.\nSpent the last year and a half researching it.\nSomething that has come to light recently is that golfers are very suseptable to Lyme Disease because we go out in the brush looking for our ball. Being in the golf business I have played in most areas of the country.  Didn't realize  that  a pro golfer here in Albuquerque,Tim Heron, had it also.\nMy PC still will not admit that I have it, partly because of hospital protocal, but we've worked out where he treats the \"Symptoms\"! In my case Headaches and Fatigue are my Biggest problem!\nI take two Oxycodone's every day and i hardly have them anymore. I've given up telling others what I take because the look at my arms for the Track Marks. Although new info I have read recently that the brusing on my arms and legs aren't from the Blood thinners I take,but now they say they are from Lyme.\nMy family still does not understand what it is like.\nI had to take a four day business trip a couple weeks ago. It was all driving 1600 miles. Worked four stright 12 hour days. I knew what would happen and it did. I have been moreorless down since them although I'm starting to feel better. Although today I slept approx 16 hours. But I'm getting my strength back.\nI don't know if you have seen but there have been two celebrities, Justin Bieber and Shania Twain who have come forward that they both have Lyme.\nIt helps to have some famous people come forward that has suffered from it! They try and explain it will never go away. I've found that people have different effects from it, but the headaches, fatigue and musscel soreness seemed to be comon.\nSorry for going on about it, but I truly believe it is misdiagnosed 90% of the time.\nI'm sure because of it as an autoimune disease and my age puts me at higher risk for the coronavirus, I reaally don't give a Hoot!\nTake Care!\nSundance(RB)\n",

She went to dozens of doctors here in California who had no idea what was wrong, and one who gave her exactly the wrong treatment. Finally, she was diagnosed correctly by the one lab in the area which knew how to test for it. In the interim, the Australia Health System was denying that it had a Lyme disease issue, and county health departments all over America were denying incidents, because, if doctors can't diagnose it and/or don't report it, then there are no county health records for it. By this time, the borreliosis had embedded itself in her connective tissue, forming shell biomes which antibiotics and other treatments couldn't break into, etc. It's a real nightmare, as you well know, and continues to be a controversial subject among some the best known researchers.

Hopefully Mayo will keep patients at a safe distance from one another, and screen and isolate any patients who might be infected.

However, just how vulnerable remains to be unknown. Researchers from China conducted a small study using data from 28 patients who were infected with COVID-19 and being treated at three different hospitals in Wuhan, China, from Jan. 13, 2020, to Feb. 26, 2020.\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to answer the following questions, including whether COVID-19-infected cancer patients will have distinct clinical courses and worse outcomes, such as death from the infection or severe pneumonia, and whether cancer patients should receive\nanti-tumor treatments as usual in epidemic areas,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nThey examined risk factors that are associated with severe events, which they defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation or death.\nThe patient population consisted of mostly men (60.7%) who were a median age of 65 years old. Lung cancer was the most frequently seen diagnosis in 25% of patients, followed by esophageal (14.3%) and breast (10.7%) cancer, and 35.7% of patients had stage 4 disease. In addition, 39.2% of patients had at least one or more coexisting chronic diseases.\nThe researchers learned that eight patients (28.6%) developed COVID-19 while undergoing therapy in the hospital and 20 (71.4%) contracted the virus from their communities \u2014 most (67.9%) were from Hankou, the starting point of the outbreak. Within two weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, 21.4% of patients received at least one type of cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy (10.7%), targeted therapy (7.1%), radiotherapy (3.6%) or immunotherapy (3.6%), and one patient received combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\nUpon admission, more than 80% of patients experienced fever, dry cough, abnormally low levels of lymphocytes in the blood and high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, which measures levels of inflammation in the body. Nearly 90% of patients showed hypoproteinemia, a condition where there is an abnormally low level of protein in the blood. Three-quarters of the population had trouble breathing and half showed signs of anemia.\nThe researchers discovered that patients with cancer showed deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from COVID-19. More than half (53.6%) developed severe events, 21.4% were admitted to ICU, 35.7% had life-threatening complications and 28.6% of the patients died.\n\u201cPatients with cancer are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia because they are at an immunosuppressive state due to malignancy and anti-tumor therapy,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt was found that within 14 days, anti-tumor therapies were significantly associated with the occurrence of severe clinical events in COVID-19 infection.\u201d\nHowever, the researchers noted, increased rate of death could be attributed to delayed hospital admission and a shortage of medical resources at the start of the coronavirus outbreak.\nThey recommended the following for patients with cancer who are undergoing therapy:  vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection, avoiding treatments that cause immunosuppression or having dosages decreased in the case of COVID-19 co-infection.\"\n",

At this point it is not known whether the hearing loss will be permanent, but for inflammatory causes, which Covid seems to be, a course of steroid treatment is standard. Some losses have been reversed, some improved, some not. \nIt is worthwhile to note that in the pre-vaccine past, viruses like measles, rubella and scarlet fever were known to cause hearing loss. Back then, it was not known that the cause was viral inflammation in the ear and there was no intervention with steroids, so the loss often became permanent. So if I were in your situation, I would definitely try the steroids.\nGood luck \u2013 be sure to let us know how things go for you.\nSue\n",

        "content": "@daphne47 I had a \"mild\" case of Covid. For me, it started with a nasty dry cough which t first I attributed to allergies. Also, there was a lot fo sneezing and congestion with a sore throat. It began on a Thursday in early October and I had no fever of which I was aware. Anyway, I decided to see my doctor and She did a COvid test as well as a strep throat test. I was surprised to hear that the COvid test came back positive. THings get a little fuzzy, but I recall feeling achy like having the flu, running a temp that was at time normal and at other times only two degrees above normal. There was extreme fatigue, yet I could do some household things, but it was hazy. My doctor insisted that I call her daily. Had my temp increased and/ or oxygen saturation drop to 90, or below, she insisted I go to one of our hospitals. Mercifully it didn't and slowly I got to a functioning level. I am still experiencing bouts of fatigue, and my sciatica has returned. Know that I was diagnosed with early small cell lung cancer and in March of 2019 underwent surgery that removed a third of my right lung. So that is a concern with anything like COVID. I hope you get tested or have done so by now. It is better for an early diagnosis in my opinion. If you do have COVID rest and follow what your body tells you. I have no idea where I caught the virus, but it spread to my housekeeper and her husband who is my handyman. I hope this helps you. Oh, also my ability to taste things was odd\u2013salty things tasted metallic and it is only this month that things have returned to normal in this area. Good luck to you. Take care.

    "content": "My very stubborn boss in his late 60\u2019s developed all of the symptoms of Covid and did nothing about it. He refused to wear a mask and refused to get tested but instead hoped it would run its course. His business is in a major financial bind and he refuses to close, even if forced to do so. I started showing symptoms 8 days later so I immediately got tested and stayed home until my results surface. They were positive. We work very closely together in a high-volume customer walk in type business. My concern is, he gave me the virus, several of our employees and not to mention the hundreds of customers that we come in contact everyday. I wear my mask religiously and wash my hands constantly. What am I to do with a stubborn, negligent man such as this? Shall I call the health department? After I recovered from Covid I was ready to return to work. He then tells me he doesn\u2019t need me right now because he can\u2019t afford to pay me because he\u2019s in such debt and business is slow. There are a lot of wrongs here and I feel like I need to make them right. This is the type of man who breaks all the rules, has no respect or consideration for anyone but himself. I need to do something. He may have recovered from the virus but the fact that he subjected so many to it including myself is something I can\u2019t forget nor forgive.",

Two days ago when CA was \"closed\" she set up to serve take outs at the door, using a portable credit card machine and keeping everyone 6 feet apart.   Then the owners came by and told her to let customers come in and sit because they probably wouldn't get caught.  Miss CLH explained that the tables did not allow 6 feet between bodies and reiterated the Governor's regulation.  \nShe thought about it, talked to her Mom and then called the owners and told them that what they were doing was unsafe and illegal and that she would not be a part of it.  She would do take out only at another location with more room.  Believe it or not, they agreed with her request.   So\u2026.this 18 year old is a toughie.  Her value system is strong and she backs it up.  \nIn addition to that, she is quite the designer, wanting to use her affinity for STEM, especially computers and photography to make better, more aesthetically pleasing technologically perfect objects, even flashy princess dresses.\nYour turn\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..what can you share\u2026\u2026how proud were you\u2026\u2026did she really hit a home run?\u2026\u2026\u2026.when are you facetiming or Zooming this week?

A kid jumped in to visit every few minutes.\nSometimes it works, sometimes not, we just roll with it. Sometimes we text ahead for them to have their favorite toy or recent project ready to show us. Sometimes Mom calls with just one on her lap and in a mellow mood for a little one-on-one visit.\nIf you are looking for a gift idea, we give our littles a subscription to Kiwi Company boxes (kiwico.com) \u2013 for 3 yo it is a Koala Crate and comes monthly, each has a theme & 4-5 age appropriate  projects to do at home. For the 1 yo it is a Panda Crate and comes every 2 months. It spreads the joy, gives parent a tool on rainy days. We give a 6 month subscription to each for birthday and Christmas, and just a token wrapped gift like a puzzle or truck. This year they will get play cooking utensils and dishes, and a simple homemade \"stove\" as pretend cooking entertains them both for hours.\nWe found the best time to be right after breakfast on a \"boring day\" \u2013 they are too crazy on the holidays or special days to settle down.

Recently, my oldest brother who has step-grandchildren with his partner, purchased the Portal Video devices and have had great success with them. You mount the camera on/near your tv and then the lens follows movement in that room, which is really helpful for the kids.  Also beneficial is that you are all watching one another through your tv rather than a laptop/tablet/phone. It might make a great early holiday gift that you can use throughout the winter!

One of his prized possessions was a small yellow Teddy named \"Spare Bear.\" When his family moved out of state Spare Bear stayed behind to be loved by all his younger cousins, and finally went to assisted living with my Mom to remind her of her firstborn grandchild. \nWhen Grammy died, I passed Spare Bear to his original owner, a struggling Dad of 4. Today he sent me a message that Spare Bear is now with his oldest granddaughter, aged 3, who is having a tough time accepting a new sibling. He thanked me for the memories, and for making sure he got his beloved bear.\nSo, if you have kids or grands struggling in these hard times, look around and see if there is an old favorite toy, blanket, quilt or afghan they might like as a memento.

Unless we all get to gether and politically (I guess) fight for a steady time, we are stuck with what we have. I try to just let it be, but I don't like our time change. It takes a goodly amount of time to get used to the changes each time change makes.

I don\u2019t know why we can\u2019t get rid of this outdated concept.  \n While the change in time doesn\u2019t bother me, it does affect how long I am able to drive during the day.  I don\u2019t drive at night anymore so I try not to get stuck anywhere where I might have to.  The reverse is true in the spring which leads me to make any early morning appointments at a time when I am more comfortable driving.  My eye clinic sees patients at 6:30\u2026good grief.   So I look forward to early nights because it\u2019s kind of cozy and also to walking at an earlier hour as I am an early riser.  And it gives me an excuse to binge a Netflix or Amazon series if it\u2019s dark outside.  On the flip side, since the the weather is nicer here in Florida there is less time to get outdoor work done.\nI usually eat dinner between 6 and 7 but sometimes feel I should eat earlier because it\u2019s so dark.  But that feeling goes away .\nAs for leaving lights on for animals\u2026my children who have dogs always leave a light on for the dogs when out.  And there are night lights all over their homes.  I hate night lights\u2026there is enough illumination from all the digital appliances and computers around the house.\nI\u2019m wondering if the early darkness will bring some people to return home earlier during this pandemic\u2026..mmmm\u2026.probably not.\nHappy Halloween\nFL Mary\n",

I've seen dentist, kidney doc, done kidney and bone density labs and been once to the hairdresser since early March and have had two repairmen inside for repairs/replacements.  Put ea. appt on calendars and watched for 14 days for any covid symptoms.  So far, very lucky.\nBecause I've lived alone and without family in state, I've found myself strangely less outwardly stressed or fearful than most others I know.  Probably because I self-quarantined early on and still remind myself to start the car to keep the battery up, I am doing all I know to stay as safe as possible.  Also I find it rather easy to entertain myself \u2026 probably because I'm pretty simple minded\u2026lol\nHowever, early on, time just seemed to meld together and each day could be \"any' on my calendar.  A sense of malaise just seemed to descend and I've become accustomed to going through daily rituals and routines sort of on automatic pilot in something like a fog.  Perhaps, for me, an early onset of a form of covid fatigue discussed by Dr. Poland.\nOur state shut down for 2 weeks before being one of the first to reopen and now is 75% reopened.  It should come as no surprise that not only have people here not observed the basic precautions but also still continue their lives \"as usual\".  \nBecause I find the media news upsetting, I've been steering clear but yesterday did check a local channel for a weather report.  It was shocking to learn that our small city of 200,00+ is now reporting 300 new covid cases/day and that our 184 ICU designated beds at our three hospitals are at near capacity. \nWe have multiple colleges, trade schools and public education choices here as well and those are adding to the increase in numbers however, the local doc giving the updated virus report made clear that it was not only the younger adults increasing the numbers but also those across all age brackets.\nI found Dr. Poland's interview particularly helpful in talking about the need for increased use of air purifiers and hepa filters.  The more possible ways to exchange air, the better.  I'll be sharing his link with family and friends because this pandemic isn't going to evaporate or come under control anytime soon.  Winter will find most of us spending more time inside as well.\nOur 10 yr old is sharing online classes with 2 others and and a hired tutor.  Each family \"hosts\" the group for one week at a time and all are observing similar virus precautions.  I think installing air purifiers for their indoor instruction times will be helpful and add another layer of protection.\nDiscussion forums here are providing a much needed added benefit now because of the sub-groups for other interest pursuits.  Thanks to all who share in these forums and a huge thanks to MayoClinic for providing this safe place to learn during these stressful, uncertain times.\n",

That was the largest \"social group\" I've been with since March.

Anticipation and looking forward to special times is so important, I just hadn't counted on my loss of spirits later.

The 6 of us have been in the same \"Covid bubble\" since June, though we wear masks when in close spaces together. We traveled in separate vehicles to 2 rooms in a favorite motel after we assured ourselves of their Covid protocols. We paid for Friday & Saturday nights to be sure the rooms were empty for over 24 hours, and arrived Saturday morning. On arrival we opened doors & windows, removed comforters from the beds & carefully sanitized all touch surfaces in both rooms (including spraying Lysol thoroughly on all fabric & vertical surfaces within reach of our little boys.) Then we spread a clean tablecloth on one bed to serve as our \"dining room.\" We brought all food for the trip except our Saturday night pizza.\nOur adventure Saturday included a walk in the North Woods where the leaves are changing, family photos at a traditional spot (our 50th year there!), special snacks, visiting Grandpa's childhood home, a romp in the park, and takeout pizza from a favorite restaurant. Then Grandpa & Grandma took the little boys to settle them down after the excitement while Mom & Dad took the dog for a walk. Sunday we went to watch the \"big trucks\" in the mine pits, and ended up playing with magnets in ore-laden dirt, seeing which rocks were magnetic and marveling at the soil that stuck to the magnets. (Daddy was as fascinated as the 4 year old.) As we left them, they were covered with red dust, headed for a night & day at Dad's (empty) family cabin, and still smiling.\nWe're exhausted, but the looks of pure joy, and the giddiness of two little boys at being in a different place and having new things to do was totally worth it! I don't think the 4 year old stopped smiling from the time he recognized the motel until he fell asleep.\nI posted this long message as an example that it is entirely possible to travel safely during Covid, though it does require extra thought & preparation. We had no personal contact with anyone except the motel manager (masked) to get the key, and the cashier at the bar (to get the pizza.) This is our fourth overnight or longer trip during Covid, and we have had no negative repercussions on any of them. In addition, we make many day trips to outdoor venues \u2013 even a walk at the beach or state park can provide relief; you can sit on a bench if walking isn't your thing.

I was extremely ill and had literally every symptom of Covid. I tested at a drive thru testing site and then ended up going to urgent care 3 days later when it became painful to breathe. They did a rapid test for Covid and it was positive. I thought if I could get steroids which is what I\u2019m usually given when sick with respiratory issues it would help me stay out of the hospital.  I was determined to not be admitted as I was afraid if I went in I may not come out.  I carefully watched my vitals, my 02 and was told if it was 94 to go to ER.  I knew that was in the norm but the urgent care doctor said she wanted me to stay safe and not wait till it got too low. But I ignored that advice and wanted to stay safe at home. If I felt like I was struggling too much I certainly would have gone to hospital.  I stayed home checked my O2 frequently and it would get as low as 90 at night but it would come back up to 94. As long as I saw it coming back up, I was happy.  The other issue about the hospital for me is I would be completely alone.  I\u2019ve heard stories of people calling for help to bathroom or whatever and it would be hours before someone would come.

As POA for mom, who resided out-of-town, it became necessary for me to establish a new bank account in my city to manage her legal, medical, home health, house maintenance & repair as well as pay home health care wages and social security taxes, her property and income taxes, etc.  When I presented my POA to the bank where I had accounts, I was told that changes in the Texas law had changed and that I would have to have an updated POA for her even though we were both residents of TX.  Thankfully for us and our longtime family atty., she was alert and capable of signing the updated POA and I was able to establish the new account for her.  \nAnother important point you encourage is for parents to set up joint accounts and to name their beneficiaries and do the same for their safety deposit boxes as well as for their investment accounts. My best friend's daughter created holy mayham over some jointly held financial accounts held by my friend and her guy.  When my friend died, the daughter, as Executrix of her mom's estate, continued to create terrible banking, investment and other legal difficulties for my friend's partner of many years. \nToo often people don't think think ahead or prepare for the complexities that those left behind will have great difficulty in accessing or managing.\n",

        "content": "@sueinmn, Yes! My best friends did much the same and set up individual as well as joint accounts which worked beautifully for them until my friend became incapacitated. \nOnce living together, they also made separate wills which clearly spelled out their intentions ( he has 5 children; she, one) and also had drawn up separate burial and funeral arrangements at a local cemetery.  The problem came when they didn't put original wills and burial plans in a bank safety deposit.  Instead, they held those in a home safe which the daughter gained access to.  The daughter refused my friend access to her mother's will and final plans and as a result sheer bedlam ensued.  Luckily, he had given one daughter a set of both documents of his but the unnecessary stress and grief caused by this disruptive mom's daughter has been a constant nightmare that hasn't stopped yet.  \nYears ago, I attended a seminar for caregivers put on by our hospital.  It was truly helpful and I found it a source of encouragement and information I needed.  However, I was utterly shocked at how many attendees there had not given thought to taking actions now that could save them a great deal of time and prevent a great deal of difficulty and stress later.  Many found it difficult talking to spouse, parent, children about declining health and end of life plans.  I hope these posts will alert others who may have been putting plans off for \"someday\" to reconsider how much easier taking action now can save in grief for those you love later.  Best to all. \n",

This means doing a will, naming guardians for them until they reach majority age, having adequate life insurance to ensure their lives will be disrupted as little as possible (sadly I did all this 2 months after my husband died, all to protect our then 4-year old son, who tragically died of an undiagnosed rare disease just months later).

We have elected to keep items in our safe at home for this reason, and our daughters know where they are and how to access.

It might signify we understand our mortality here on earth, it might look to others we are figuring to pass soon, there are a multitude of reasons. In 2015, I was single, and had been diagnosed with a rare kidney disease. There is no treatment, and it may progress rapidly, or slowly. So, I got all my affairs in order, including planning for end-of-life wishes, prepaying for final costs, DPOA, will, etc. I even wrote my own obituary. Morbid? No. I come from a legal background, and had seen the consequence of more than one person passing with no arrangements or determinations expressed. \nForward now to my current situation, where I am married, we own joint property, but there are still individual assets. It is an ongoing struggle to get my husband to commit to putting things in writing. My explanation that \"saying it\" doesn't mean it will hold up in court of law has not penetrated into his brain, yet. \nOne thing I have insisted on, is that I carry two medications lists. One is my own list, that is kept updated. Also, I keep a typed out list of what my husband takes. If he were to have a crisis, I need to be able to give this info to a medical professional. Not at home on the computer. Right there in my purse. I am signed up for MedicAlert, and wear a MedicAlert bracelet. There is a phone number and record ID that a medical professional can access to get my meds and conditions, if need be. It gives me peace of mind. https://www.medicalert.org/\nBefore the end of the year, I will have all paperwork in place, again, with my husband's input and everything current.

I wish I could impress on your hubby and so many others who put off creating their estate plans and final wishes the importance of doing so.  It took a stroke for me to realize the urgency in updating my affairs and making them readily available for my daughter.   The peace of mind I have, like yours, of having my affairs in order is incomparable. \"Saying it\" as you wrote has no bearing in a court of law as my dear friend has recently learned the hardest of ways. \nBecause my best friends were not married and held both joint and separate accounts and properties like you and your hubby, they'd made individual wills and burial plans.  However, lack of access to his partner's documents prevented my friend from carrying out her wishes and left him in terrible uncertainty about his own immediate and continuing access to the home they'd shared for over 20 years.\nAfter 5 months of my friend's daughter creating daily sheer hell across the board with medical/home care/ investment/banking/insurance and other personnel involved, she confronted my friend with untenable ultimatums and choices regarding his continuation in the home my friends shared and maintained together.  \nPresented with agreements Saturday she'd had an atty. draw up for him to sign, he told her that she'd left him no choice but to start legal common law spousal actions earlier advised by his atty.  She was shocked by his response.  She was packed and along with her daughter and one dog was planning to finally absent the house today and return home to Denver.  Now, re-negotiations will take place and this time with legal counsel.  \nGinger, I especially thank you for the link to the medical alert site! I was unaware of this service and the i.d. options it offers!  Yay!  I'd looked at id to order at another time but didn't find anything that provided what I wanted like name/phone/addr. This org. sounds wonderful by providing the emergency info medical pros would need. \nMay I ask if you chose the bracelet or necklace for id? Would the dog tag necklace @$25 or mesh chain bracelet at $35 provide all I'd need?  I couldn't tell from the site what info would be on either\u2026just name? malady? Did you go with the Advantage Plan for $50/yr?  \nBecause I am a frequent walker and have had a stroke, I am particularly interested in having immediate, on-person id that would alert someone for help.\nI'll be calling the site this week and am delighted at the peace of mind it offers.  If this is too off topic, could you please private message me about your choices if you feel comfortable doing so?   Hugs and more!  P.S.

I placed a second order for this one:  This is the one I ordered and highly recommend for comfort and easy breathing:  $13  https://www.etsy.com/listing/813425809/purple-dare-active-wear-sports-face-mask?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=nylon+facemask+with+velcro+strap&ref=sc_gallery-1-5&plkey=4cd3efd9022d888fc821702318cced1d3c104213%3A813425809&bes=1\n",

To say I was anxious beforehand would be an understatement!\nHere are some things we did:\n\u2013 Called and asked about precautions being taken before reserving our hotel rooms.\n\u2013 Stocked up on masks (reuseable ones), sanitizing wipes (including several in baggies for our pockets-see below) and pet waste bags (for touching gas pumps.)\n\u2013 Planned our route to allow stops at rest areas (less people than truck stops) when possible.\n\u2013 Carried all our own food and beverages & disposable tableware for the 3 day trip, including evening meals to warm up in the hotel. Sanitized refrig and microwave before using. We elected not to try takeout because we had no idea what restaurants would be available.\n\u2013 Used sanitizer wipes thoroughly in all restrooms and hotel rooms and on surfaces we touch in the car after each stop.\n\u2013 Wore masks in all rest/truck stops, hotels common areas and elevators.\n\u2013 Showered and washed our hair before going to bed, and changed all outer clothes each day. Washed and dried all masks each evening.\n\u2013 Used our own pillows and blankets.\nHere are some things we observed:\n\u2013 Most people were not wearing masks, but many tried to maintain distance, especially retail workers and truck drivers, who seemed aware that the extra exposure to people put them at risk.\n\u2013 Self-serve areas were mainly closed in truck stops and hotels, a single employee poured coffee, bottled drinks were sold, hotel employees gave out brown bag breakfasts of packaged items in lieu of a buffet.\n\u2013 Hotels had shields at their desk, or set out paperwork a safe distance from the employee, they were busy sanitizing surfaces between customers.\n\u2013 Less traffic, except trucks.\nSo, travel is possible, just not very much fun right now. 7 days later, we survived the trip nicely, and are in day 7 of our self-quarantine, feeling just fine, thank you.\nNext week, we will both be heading (locally) to rescheduled lab and medical appointments. I am anxiously hoping thumb repair surgery is in my near future, so I'll be waiting to hear about anyone else's experience in clinic/same day surgery.\nSue\n",

Arrival I decided that I would only take in what I absolutely needed so I opted for cell phone and charger plus Clorox wipes for sanitizing bathroom prior to using(actually I've done that since my bout with cdif last year)\nAt the main doors they would ask questions about fever, cough and take your temp. Then you get a name tag and can bypass the other blds once you were checked at one.\nNo one but the patient was allowed in so for caregivers I would plan on staying in your car for short visits or maybe a hotel room for longer days.  There was a food truck outside and the better quality portable bathrooms outside.  But also you could get items inside and bring them out to your caregiver. I went by myself since I live about 1.5 hours away.  I'm actually hoping they can figure out a way to let caregivers in since in jun I have a procedure that requires a driver and I don't want to make my wife stay outside all day.\nWhile getting the treatment the nurses wore masks and I was also masked.  I was offered either a room or the chair and I decided on the chair.  I did snack while getting the treatment felt confident that I was safe.\nI ate every meal in the cafeteria where everyone was taking extra precaution 6 ft apart and face masks by all.  I brought my own mask a disposable one that I have from home. I was there for blood work and my monthly IVIG treatment. \nThe seating areas are arranged with taped seats to maintain 6 ' clearance between people. The dining room was almost empty so it was easy to sit away from others.  \nOnce I was done I proceeded back to the car and wiped down everything I took in and disposed of my mask.  Sanitized my hands before getting in the car.\nUpon getting home which both my wife and I do whenever we are out in the community(except walking outside) we change our clothes in the laundry room (which is the first room coming from the car) and throw them in the washer.  If its grocery day (which my wife does alone) I prepare some bleach water and get ready to wipe down everything she bought again right at the laundry room we toss the bags.  Then we also wipe down our cars with the sanitizer anything we have touched.  So I think that's everything if you have any questions please ask.\nHave a Blessed Day\nDana\n",

Some of the employees that were working from home are back to seeing patients in person.

Some clinic employees have been furlough, others doing job of multiple co-workers,  others reassigned to new areas, and some services may not be available.  So  please remember that the changes  due to COVID are stressful to both patients and employees. \nHere are few things you will find different then few months ago.\n\u2013 Before you go, may get call from Mayo employee going over COVID-19  information.\n\u2013 There is limit on visitors, check web site if bringing anyone with you.\n\u2013 Arrive early, the screening process will take extra time.\n\u2013 Parking ramps are open, and you have to pay again.   I use charge card because do not want to handle money.\n\u2013 I do not think valet  service is currently available, check mayo site for latest info.\n\u2013 Bring a mask,  all employee and patients are required to wear a mask.\n\u2013 All elevators have an occupancy limit  (5 or 6).  So be prepared to wait till there is one with room.\n\u2013 When enter any clinic building, 1st they will take your temp.  Then another person will ask questions if you have been tested, been around anyone exposed to COVID or have list of symptoms.  I answered no to all questions.  If answer yes, I think you have to have additional screening.   You will get a sticker with the day of week to wear while in clinic buildings. .\n\u2013 You are not required to have COVID test for appointment, but if having procedure or surgery, it may be required.  \nI try to avoid touching surfaces, but that is impossible, so I use the hand sanitizers located around clinic.  One advantage of wearing a mask, it keeps me from touching my face. \nOne thing I have found helpful is to keep hand sanitizer in car.  I use every time I get back in car and before I take my mask off.    \nHave a safe trip\nLaurie\n",

If you are visiting Rochester and staying at either Doubletree, Hilton Garden Inn or The Hilton Rochester Mayo Clinic area there cleaning protocol is as follows;\n1.\tWhat cleaning protocols are you following at this time? (We are finding this to be a common question.). We have applied extremely throughout and robust cleaning programs at our hotels. Additionally, we have implemented many key components of the newly released Hilton Corporate Clean Stay Program, providing hospital grade cleaning to our hotel rooms. \nAll Employees: All team members wear masks while in guest facing areas. \nFront Desk:\n\u2022\tContinuous disinfecting of front desk and common touch points.\n\u2022\tDisinfectant of pens (or other materials) after each guest use.\n\u2022\tGuest room key cards that are returned to the front desk are set aside and disinfected before going back into rotation. \nConcierge/Executive Lounge:\n\u2022         Touch points and common areas in Executive Lounge are disinfected hourly. \nGuestrooms:\n\u2022\tIn-room collateral that cannot be disinfected has been removed (examples: menus, hotel directories, other notifications, etc.)\n\u2022\tRooms on day of arrival are being disinfected with Ecolab Peroxide Multi-surface clean and disinfectant, a fast acting, hospital grade chemical. This takes place throughout the guestroom and certainly in Hilton's noted 10-high touch point areas (please see attached graphic).\n\u2022\tThe efforts above are in addition to traditional housekeeping services.\nPublic Spaces:\n\u2022\tPublic spaces and touch points (hand rails, elevator buttons, guest laundry, etc.) are continuously disinfected throughout the day (multiple times per day).\n\u2022\tHand sanitizing dispensers have been placed in all entrance points, as well as and common public areas (i.e. elevator banks). \nBell/Transportation:\n\u2022\tBell staff are required pre-shift screening, which includes taking of temperature. In addition, they are required to wear masks at all times.\n\u2022\tThe hotel courtesy vehicles are disinfected between each use.\n\u2022\tValet parking: Bell staff is required to wear mask and gloves. The guests vehicle is sanitized in areas such as driver seat, steering wheel, door handles, etc.\nAvailable to Guests:\n\u2022\tDisinfectants as well as sterile rags are available for individual guest use (should they wish to take independent precautions). \nHousekeeping services are willing and able to accommodate the needs of our guests. Turn down service, switching of guestroom linens and requesting additional supplies are happily accommodated. It is certainly the goal of the hotel to provide our guests the highest level of comfort and security that we are able to.  \n2.\tWhat is the status of your shuttle service and what cleaning procedures are they following?\nBell/Transportation:\n\u2022\tBell staff are required pre-shift screening, which includes taking of temperature.

So\u2026use good hygiene practices on your part.\nThat said, we just made a 1500 mile trip, through not only hotels, but many (questionable) truck stops and rest areas. We each carried a little ziploc baggie with sanitizer wipes into every stop, and wiped down surfaces before using. I finished the wipe down in restrooms by wiping the handle and seat of the commode before using. I also carried paper towels because I personally don't think hand dryers are very sanitary.\nWe (usually) travel extensively, spending many nights in hotels every year, and have always used our own sanitizers on surfaces upon entering. In addition we carry a small bottle of dish detergent to wash things and our own roll of paper towels, this time I added my own towel on which to set them to dry. I have never worried about using the plastic-wrapped glasses, the tissues or tp in hotel rooms and still don't. We do bring our own pillows, but our experience on this trip was that hotels are really working to keep everything clean and everyone safe.

The last treatment my dad had in Mayo FL (last week), more care professionals were wearing masks. This was comforting to him. Visitors should know that there are signs posted on the road leading into campus that indicate visitors are asked to stay away from the hospital and ER. It's not clear whether visitors are discouraged from accompanying a patient who is receiving outpatient infusions, for example. In the Mangurian building in FL, there is a table set up right by the entrance to query people on their health status, etc. Out of an abundance of caution, I chose to forgo accompanying my dad during his daylong visit. I did not want to be exposed to the virus. Normally I would help him get from labs to in-person clinical encounter to infusion clinic. He is able to handle this on his own for the most part fortunately. I don't know what we would do if he was not able to move under his own power. Perhaps a volunteer would be available to help? Fortunately my dad was able to acquire masks from a local pharmacy. These are hard to come by. It would be nice if Mayo provided PPE to patients with underlying conditions. This may be the case. I did not inquire at the entry checkpoint. \nI need to travel back to my home state and return in a week. When I do, I will quarantine for 14 days in a vacation rental. Then I will be available to be the designated driver for the next monthly infusion appointment. Traveling and caregiving is a lot more complicated now. Plan accordingly.\nMost other visits are telemed now. This is a huge challenge for both patient and provider. Once the technical hurdles are dealt with, the encounter quality and level of care is just as good as in person from the patient's perspective. We should have been doing this all along. \n",

We opted for a small RV which can be parked at the medical facility, sometimes even overnight. They are available to rent if you don't want to take the dive into ownership and actually cost about the same as staying in a hotel and paying for restaurant food. I recommend googling class B or C RVs for rent by owner in your area. A class B is no different than driving a regular van, but has a kitchen, bathroom, and bed. A class C is roomier and really not difficult to drive, especially if it is 24' or so feet and you don't try towing a car behind it. Owners registered through rental groups must adhere to strict sanitizing procedures between rentals, but I will do my own when I head to Mayo JAX for breast radiation for 5 days in June. When renting from an owner, prices are often negotiable, and may be decreased when they are advised of a medical need. Many owners are not traveling right now due to partial or total park closures so are renting theirs for at least the time being. I'm no real expert, but may be able to answer simple questions any of you have. For me, this is just the easiest, least scary way to travel right now.\n",

Our experience at the Mayo Clinic was exactly as described in the Mayo Clinic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) Safe in-person and virtual care >  https://www.mayoclinic.org/covid-19\nOur tempurature was taken and we were asked the routine COVID19 exposure questions.  The process went very quickly and we were given a day/date specific sticky tag to wear so that we could, leave/return to the clinic if we had a space ot time between appointments.  My appointments were spaced very closely together and we ate n the Mayo cafeteria afterwards.\nEveryone in Mayo, staff and patients and the construction workers, wore masks and practiced safe distancing, so we were very comfortable there and even learned that wearing a mask all day was not impossible!\nDuring each of my appointments, I experienced the same care as I would have had on any of my previous visits, hand sanitizer was offered and everyone practicd safe hygeine.  \nOur trip was thru Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota.  The Coronavirus travel advice ( https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-safe-travel-advice/art-20486965 ) that has been shared in this discussion was our travel guide.  We also found a very easy at-a-glance list of reopenings by state on \u2013 List of Coronavirus-Related Restrictions in Every State. This gave us an idea of how the different states were reopening.\nhttps://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2020/coronavirus-state-restrictions.html\nNeedless to say, it was interesting for us as the traffic was lighter than usual, the rest stops were nearly empty, and the gas/food marts were where we saw the most people.  Husband wore plastic gloves to pump gas, and we did not go inside or have contact with anyone. We had drinks and snacks in the car.  \nMy take-awy from our trip is that WE are able to control the distance and the number of interactions with others.  WE can choose to wear masks and We can practice our hand hygiene and use disinfectants for surfaces.\nWe have also decided to get tested mid week and to self-isolate due to our travel.\n",

It is customary to have it on if one has a cold or not feeling well. This is a courtesy and preventative measure. My county has lifted the mandatory mask requirement, major shopping centers, gym, hair salons and stores are opening. Even Disneyland plans to open next month. I will continue to wear my mask if I have to go anywhere. I don't really care if people give me strange looks.

        "content": "I traveled to Mayo Rochester and had surgery a week and a half ago for an ankle fracture.  We stayed in a hotel room with a kitchen and arrived with our own spray cleaners and paper towels and cleaned every surface.  I also brought hydrogen peroxide and a spray bottle and sprayed fabric surfaces like the towels and the inside of the refrigerator and freezer, microwave inside and put, and the sheets on the bed, and the couch.  We brought our own pillows and comforter and simply rolled back what was there and put the hotel pillows in the closet.  I didn't want to put my face where other people have had theirs, and I don't know if any maid or cleaning staff have infections, so I wanted to avoid soft surfaces unless I had cleaned them myself.  The hotel towels are washed well, but who knows if they are contaminated by staff, so I sprayed a specific towel on both sides to use with hydrogen peroxide and hung it to dry.  I also brought my own small towel for my hands and face, so I could avoid the hotel towel in my vulnerable places.  We cleaned the remote and all the door handles.  I travel with my own air filter that is a combination of carbon and HEPA filtration, so that was set up to clean the air.  I had masks and we brought all our own food and put out the do not disturb sign, so no one entered our room for the week we were there.  I didn't place anything like bags on the floor, but only on surfaces and in storage areas that I had previously cleaned.  I presumed the floor may not be sanitary, but that was too much to worry about, so nothing went on the floor and I lived on the couch with my leg propped up on a folding stool that I brought and pillows.   We did pass hotel staff in the corridors not wearing masks, who then put one on as we passed. \nAt Mayo, the entry screening was complete with questions and a \"No touch\" temperature scan and we got our stickers for access.  I was tested for COVID by nasal swab and serum antibody tests as a prerequisite to having surgery, and passed with flying colors.  This was my second swab test.  I was tested at the emergency room when I had the first procedure for my broken ankle to just stabilize it so the swelling could go down some before reconstructive surgery. There were not many patients at Mayo as compared to my first visit in 2016, and I saw the most patients at waiting areas for testing.  I was using one of their wheelchairs and asked, and the chairs are wiped down after every patient use.  I had my hand sanitizer with me and used it after pressing elevator buttons.   It is kind of strange meeting the surgical team and not knowing what they look like under all the PPE.   What you can see is their eyes behind a clear face shield or eye protector and look at their badge to see how they normally look.  So the surgeon probably looked just how he does when he's in the operating room, and the anesthesia guy had a beard on his badge, but he had to shave it for COVID so the masks so would fit tightly.  What I noticed were the style choices nurses had for their caps to hold their hair with colorful patterns.  I did feel safe at Mayo and was wearing my mask.  I have never seen Mayo with so few patients and if felt somewhat empty.  When I checked in for surgery, there was no one else waiting except one person that finished as I got there, and there were not a lot of patients in the other pre-surgery bays.  The first time I had surgery at Mayo, there were probably 20 to 30 people at the check in area when I arrived first thing in the morning.  They had hand sanitizer, and after every time I had to sign an electronic form, I got a shot of it.\nOur stops at rest areas and gas stations were very brief and we wore our masks and used the buttons that open doors for wheelchair access.  I was hobbling along with a walker, and could press that with a hip or elbow, and back at the car, hand sanitizer for hands that touched anything.   Some people held the door open for me which I appreciated at a gas stop before we left Rochester.  I also spray my outside and inside car door handles and steering wheel as a precaution, but I was in the back seat this time with my driving leg on medical leave.  I would also hold my breath if someone passed by closely during these stops.  I've also made a practice of washing my hands a lot at the sink and also my face.. why not?  Since touching your face can spread germs and maybe I have some on my face that landed there by itself, but not rubbed into my eye, if I wash my face often, I lessen the risks.\n",

We are from Texas, and given the increase in cases in our area, I am highly concerned about us traveling (by plane on American Airlines) to Rochester.  His PCP and Kidney Specialist say all should be fine with precautions being taken. \nI am not worried about our actual visit at Mayo due to the amazing feedback I have read on this forum, but have apprehensions about the flight.  It seems most that posted on this forum have driven, but that's not an option for us.  I'm not sure what feedback I'm looking for (ha!), but any is appreciated.  Should we postpone again given the flight, are there opportunities for remote evaluation until we do ultimately make a plan to drive or go once Covid cases trend down?  Thanks for any help and feedback!\n",

Maybe a plane type that has 2 seats on a side.  Plus facemask and lots of sanitizing.  I would also inquire as to the airlines and what they are doing to help with sanitizing and precautions. I would also weigh the benefits and or concerns waiting any longer.  This seems like it may be the best time frame due to the regular flu season starting up again in a few months.\nHave an awesome Blessed Day\nDana \n",

I spoke with the PA in the Cardiovascular Surgery Dept on Wednesday this week to go over Covid-19 questions. They have changed the appointment schedule for Pre-Op patients. Now all Pre-op lab work is done through one 'stick' at your Covid test. Both nasal and blood are tested. Your companion is only screened by questions and has to wear a mask, as all who enter do. So consolidating the labs with Covid was a good idea. Less stress. And those who face surgery surely are stressed.\nWe are taking hand sanitizer, wipes for surfaces, wearing masks and will practice the 6 ft social distance to the best of our ability. I would hate to get exposed to this virus in the airport after three months of being stuck at home and not going anywhere. So first trip out 'there' for us. Lots of testing ahead. And then the big surgery on the 8th. This site has been great for information and encouragement. I'll be thinking about the others here who are going to Mayo this month. God Bless America!

Last time my doctor wanted me to consider a Statin but I didn't like the idea. So he let me get a CT scan for something called calcium score. My calcium score was 0 which means no plaque so I didn't have to take statin. I recommend getting a calcium score if any doctor thinks you should take a statin. Calcium scores are more accurate than those probability scores of heart attack or stroke in 10 years. But the CT scan I got show a little node in my lung. So now I have to go back for another CT scan to see what happened to the node. Hope it hasn't changed. I really would not worry about Coronavirus at Mayo Clinic. You have to go through questions, a temp check, and wear a mask to enter clinic buildings. Plus it looks very clean. I never worry when I am at Mayo Clinic.

My calcium score was 0 which means no plaque whatsoever which means no atherosclerosis. So that means the chance of heart attack or stroke is actually very low. So I don't need statin. Just because someone has high cholesterol doesn't mean the person has plaque. So I came to conclusion that you can't just put someone on a statin based on blood cholesterol. Calcium score is more accurate. I'm in executive health program so I get a doctor that is a thinking and listening doctor. Plus I can get a CT scan for calcium score.

The flight is 5+ hours with one layover (I\u2019d likely fly Delta). I\u2019m not worried about cleanliness at Mayo, but am very worried about the travel itself. If I drive, then there are hotels and rest stops along the way. If I fly, it\u2019s exposure to everyone at the airport and on the plane. I\u2019m young, but high-risk with multiple preexisting conditions, yet my doctors here think it\u2019s even higher risk for me to stay here and not go to Mayo for further diagnostics/treatment. I\u2019ve read all the guidelines about travel, have face masks, shields, gloves, etc. but I\u2019m curious about people with actual firsthand experience doing this over the last couple months.

We have made a couple of trips, including a 24 hour one from Winter to Summer residences at the end of April with 2 overnight stops, and a 5 day vacation. \nHere is how we did it:\n-I plotted the trip via our normal route, and contacted hotels to ask their Covid precautions, then chose 2 which sounded the safest.\n-We planned & packed all of our meals & snacks enroute, freezing soup & chili to eat in our room in the evening (most hotels have microwaves.) We packed our own dishes & utensils, as well dish soap & paper towels. We did eat the hotels' \"to go\" breakfasts & drank their coffee & tea.\n-Another option is to pack prepackaged meals that do not require refrigeration \u2013 there are a lot of options on the grocery shelves. Or takeout meals from the drive-thru window of the many fast food restaurants that surround hotels.\n-When we entered out hotel room, we immediately wiped all hard surfaces with sanitizer wipes, and sprayed all soft surfaces with Lysol. (We removed bedspreads to the closet in hotels which had them.)\n-We tried to make our rest stops at wayside rests or very large, busy truck stops (found them cleanest) masked but did not glove and carried in sanitizer wipes in ziplock baggies to clean surfaces before using, then sanitized our hands again before getting into the car. We also frequently wiped down the \"touch surfaces\" in our car. We found smaller gas stations not as good about keeping clean.\nWe have come through our trips very safely \u2013 even making a short vacation trip where we ate outdoors in a restaurant & shopped quickly in a local grocery for extra items.\nWith respect to personal physical precautions, please keep in mind that masks which are worn should be handled as though contaminated & discarded safely or stowed in a bag and washed promptly. We carry at least 3 washable masks each, and hand wash and air dry at the end of each day. We also each carry N-95 masks to wear in case of close contact with anyone over a period of time. \nGloves are a special concern. They are meant to be worn once and safely discarded. Repeatedly putting the same pair of gloves on & off results in contaminating them inside and out AND potentially carries the virus from one location to another. Unless you have access to boxes of surgical gloves, it is better to be careful what you touch and to thoroughly wash or sanitize your hands frequently. We carry hand sanitizer \"spritzers\" in pocket, purse & car and refill from a larger bottle.\nFace shields are intended as extra protection for prolonged or close contacts, and meant to be worn with a face mask. They are not adequate protection by themselves. \nGood luck in your travels & treatment.\nSue\n",

When I came to Mayo, we walked into the hotel suite (with a kitchen) and cleaned every surface including the inside of the refrigerator, freezer, microwave, all doorknobs, etc.  I clean the surface before I put my bag down on it, and if we use the hotel's cart, I spray it first.  I don't put anything on the floor.  I have my own collapsable wagon which is good for bringing my gear.   I bring paper towels and spray bottles of hydrogen peroxide (and refills).  It's economical, unscented as does the job.  I spray all the soft surfaces like the couch, chairs,etc.  I remove the bedding and pillows except for the fitted sheet, and use my own instead.  I spray the fitted sheet with hydrogen peroxide and let it dry.  I also spray both sides of any towels or washcloths we will use and hang them to dry.  Sometimes we bring our own towels. I put the hotel's dishes, silverware, glassware that we plan to use into the dishwasher we we arrive and run it.  I don't unload that; we just take out things as we need them.  When we check out, I load the dishwasher and run it.  I also bring my own HEPA filter.  I have been using them at home for years because of allergies and asthma, so that is kind of normal for me, but surely will help clear the air.\nOf course, I have lots of good surgical masks and a respirator as well as BUFF neck gators that I can put over my masks.  The respirator has equivalent particle filtration to N 95 and fits tight.   Every time I remove a mask, it gets the hydrogen peroxide treatment and is left to dry.  I also have hand sanitizer that I bring and keep with me, but I don't leave stuff in a hot car that contains alcohol.  Bread wrappers and sleeves from bagels or english muffins are good to use as a glove for gas pumps, door knobs and ATM's and they are easy to wash and sanitize and you don't have issues turning them inside out like you do with a glove.  They easily turn inside out so you can keep the dirty side inside, and later sanitize it for reuse. I have also cleaned ATM screens before using them with paper towels and a spray cleaner.\n",

So I am happy and pleased that I can make homemade facemasks to the Mayo Clinic standard. They always require the best no matter what it is. I use 100% quilting cotton or cotton sheets for the front. Then I use premium muslin for the interface. Then I cut 2\" or 3\" elastic bands into narrow ribbons for ear loops. I also use 100% cotton quilting thread. Then I iron pleats into a starburst pattern so that when do my final sewing that the facemasks have a concave shape. That's more comfortable for the wearer. ",

My throat looked like dawn of the dead Lol. Nasty. I could swallow but it was strange looking. So aweek later I went to urgent care for another test. The Dr came in gave the test I asked her to look in my throat . She did and backed away and said I was shedding. Then she asked if I would be interested in antibody testing. So I did that. Later my negative came back. Now we are in late August. My throat is still nasty now it has bumps in the back and I have a puss pocket on my tonsil. She thought strep did throat culture came back neg. But took antibiotics. Than my throat started turning white. Tongue.now she thinks maybe thrush or not.

Can't vouch for its validity but the credentials are good, it seems well researched and references are extensive.  It is somewhat lengthy\u2026initially speaking to the body's inflammatory response to a virus, then the possible immune systems overreaction resulting in a cytokine storm. (where the body really gets into trouble)  Towards the end are steps that could lessen that response which includes NAC, Vit D, Curcumin, Zinc and if in a hospital situation,  high dosage of intravenous Vit C. I did read elsewhere that 1,000 mg supplements of C (3 times a day) is beneficial but have read conflicting info on that. I think we are all very concerned as we are more at risk than the general population. Though reading about cytokine storms is pretty darn scary,  I am hoping that you too will find some comfort in the fact that there are recommendations to help.  Please let me know your thoughts on it and if you feel it is helpful, I will repost again in a few days in case folks missed it.

I think at the moment they just ask 3 questions like probably 1) have you traveled outside the country 2) Have you been exposed to anyone who is sick 3) Are you having flu-like symptoms. As this flu ramps up though; I feel certain the pre-cautions before entering will be greater. As for the cleaning of your house; please try not to be OCD about it.

We prepare and eat food separately, except for the occasional foray by one or two to get takeout and bring it back.  Anyone new to the park is not part of our group \u2013 we talk to them from the road as one would a neighbor, and apologize for not being our usual inclusive selves. A neighbor had a larger gathering on Saturday that includes people we did not know, and we all chose not to go to avoid introducing anything new to the small group. We shun the common areas, including the pool, except the laundry, which I use in the morning immediately after it is sanitized. We have washed hands and sanitized everything short of drinking the stuff. Everyone must make their own decision about how to protect  themselves, this is ours.\nStay well and stay safe everyone.\nSue\n",

The Health experts recommend, and at this point even requires, almost from all none essential people, and for understandable reasons, to stay home, even if you are healthy, young and fearless! Because as we all know, we are all part of an invisible link that attaches us all one to another, when it comes to the ability of this Viral infection to get to us.\nIn our family's case, we live in a suburb of New York, we are blessed with a 43 years old son, that has Chronic Cardiac issues since birth, and he is of course extremely vulnerable if he will be exposed to this contagious virus.\nHe is not part of any statistics, that calls for percentages of people that will survive from this age group or another. He has 0% chances to recover from such a viral infection, no matter where he is going to be treated, or how many respirators they will have available.\nHis only chance of survival, is what we decided to do 4 weeks ago, when we realized that this Pandemic, will be everywhere, and we went into complete isolation with him at home. We don't go out, we don't allow anyone to cross our door front, we have medications for months, and for his sake we will stay in this isolation for as long as it takes.\nBut these vulnerable and elderly people, need the help and cooperation of the young and healthy people around us, by staying home, practice social distancing, even if they feel it's difficult. Yes it is difficult, but as a healthy society that wants to have as little victims as possible, in a crisis like this we cannot behave in a egocentric way, and think only about ourselves. They say it's a War, that is true, and in this war the war zone is not in a faraway country, like we have known in the past. It's right here, and yes the soldiers are the caregivers in hospitals, and those that keep providing us with the daily needs, but in addition to these soldiers at the front, we are also part of this ongoing war, and we have to do our part, by acting with responsibility.\nStay Safe, and this Black Cloud will melt away eventually, and we will come out of it better in all aspects of Life. \n",

When I get my groceries home I put the bags on the floor which I had previously washed with Lysol. Then remove each product one at a time & spray it with a Lysol spray & put it on my table to dry. I also spray my mail & mailbox handle. Lately reports have told us to make sure we have a will. I haven't gotten that far but I have been going through all my very old documents which are now defunct & shredding them since I never had the time to do it until now.

I recently volunteered with an Etsy mask maker to \"trial\" her new design for an elastic behind the head style.

Once I've connected the Velcro to the right tightness, I can simply slip the mask down when it's not needed, to hang loose, and then slip it back it when needed again. If the Velcro closure is at the back of the head above the ears, you can do the same: once the connection is right, leave it connected and lift it up\u2026which will mess up your hair, of course. I'm most comfortable wearing a shield instead of a mask\u2026at least until my 75# beast stood on it while we were driving to do river surveys. <g> I need to replace the face section of the shield, as now my view has \"wrinkles\" that are quite distracting.\n",

At my request she used thinner, softer elastic and made the ear loops longer so they will not pinch/be too tight around my ears; so far this is the best type of mask for me and my head.  No two head shapes are identical  \u2014  what works for one may be a disaster for others.  Except for traditional hats I have never been comfortable wearing anything around my head, tied to my head nor having anything tied under my chin\u2026.(never wore scarves on my head, tied under my chin or around my neck).   My \"guinea pig\" mask maker initially sent me a mask made with elongated velcro fastening.  It was impossible to  comfortably \"tighten\" the velcro without pinching my face/head.  No matter how I positioned the velcro fasteners around my head, the mask would begin creeping up my face till it was blocking the bottom of my eyes.  Since velcro fasteners masks refused to stay in place on the back of my head they had to be discarded.  Velcro is a great idea for those who can comfortably use it.\n",

By then, we have adjusted incrementally, often automatically, without much thought. When there is a sudden radical shift required, we often are brought up short by requirements thrust upon us. Some of us \"go along\" with the plan, some of us rebel. We grieve for things not done, or plans not played out due to the immediate nature of the change. It's normal, it's natural, and it is how we either respond or react that is the telling of our character.\nGinger\n",

There have been way too many lies that have hurt millions of people and the distrust that has occurred as a result. When we feel betrayed we can not reconcile that feeling until something is done about it and nothing has been done about COVID-19 as yet by the people who we should have been able to trust all along. We might be grieving for all of these things now that we have lost or for things that have changed. But to grieve, truly grieve, we need to miss something that will never be back and we don't know what will be back and what won't. This is particularly important to me because of my lung cancer. I no longer have the freedom to walk among friends, meet in public places for a drink or go tot he drugstore in fear of becoming sicker.

The 4 year old especially misses friends, going places and going to school. We avoid Covid conversations around the kids except to explain about germs, masks and safety in language they can get. \nWe try to have a flexible routine to each day \u2013 dress, eat, active play, snack, screen or learning time, lunch, quiet or nap, snack, active play, learning or reading, supper, active play, bath, read, cuddle, bed.\nOu best strategies to date are planning tiny adventures \u2013 as small as taking a ball and running around the now-unused high school baseball field, or taking a snack and sitting on the curb watching construction workers.  On Friday night,  weather permitting, they camp in the back yard with Mom and Dad. We play outside for hours in every kind of weather and take walks \u2013 activity seems to ease the frustration and whining. \nWe make a big deal of praising all good behavior, and use comforting, massage and cuddling for frustrated behavior instead of discipline. The boys will now bring each other their favorite \"lovey\" when they see one another sad or crying. (Real naughtiness still earns a timeout or loss of privilege \u2013 hitting, biting,etc.) And we make sure tired children rest and hungry ones eat \u2013 our body schedule is not necessarily theirs.\nThe 4 yo likes to be helpful, but isn't always sure how, so recently we're teaching him how to walk the dog, get him to heel & give the dog praise. Then we brag to Daddy how well he did when Daddy gets home.\nMy niece has a mix of kids from 1 -13, both home-and-public schooled plus a toddler. She invents bicycle errands for her older ones, and makes sure each boy gets personal time alone each day. She admitted that she has relaxed her schedule, no longer requiring schoolwork to be completed by 2 pm.  My nephew was working 4 day weeks until recently, and 2-3 days were spent camping each week, with canoe & bikes. Finally, she has allowed the kids to connect with their friends through approved video games \u2013 previously very limited.\nWe don't call learning tasks school work (oldest is in pre-k) we call it projects, and he sits alongside an adult working on their own project while he does it, so he feels grown up and important. We also explore nature, rocks, plants, bugs, leaves, seeds, footprints\u2026 The younger, 19 months spends a lot of time worn on Mom or auntie's back \u2013 he's too heavy for me. \nSeveral of my nieces are primary teachers and they say a kindergartener should have about one hour, no more of lessons in a day. Add 15-30 minutes for each grade level. Remember a lot of those 7-8 hours kids are gone are transportation, moving between activities, recess, snack, lunch etc. Attention span, even in most adults, is only about 20 minutes, so we cannot expect a child to sit and work independently for an hour or more. \nThe hardest thing to remember is that children are mirrors, and will reflect what they see & hear, so we need to be good models. \nNo doubt this is hard! We need to do everything we can to make it as peaceful as possible for our little people and their parents. If you cannot be with them, maybe you can provide their favorite casserole or a delivery or takeout meal so Mom doesn't have to think about supper. \nSue\n",

If too tight, you can string 2 or more twist ties together.\n2 \u2013 Use a shoelace or ribbon to tie between the loops and slip over your head. Adjust the tie to keep the loops out of the way of hearing aids.\n3 \u2013 IF you have elastic twill or bias tape in the house, you can cut the loops at the center, add a piece (sewn or knotted) between the two cut ends on top. Add another piece between the 2 cut ends on the bottom. Presto, you have an around-the-head mask.\nYou may need to put the mask on, then put the aids in. Finally, as a last resort, ask among friends and family for tie-on masks. We've made 48 so far, and go back into production making more tomorrow.\nStay calm, stay safe, stay hopeful.\nSue\n",

        "content": "New favorite face mask pattern!\nI have made and given away hundreds of face masks, over half to seniors, and do not ever use the ear loops \u2013 always elastic or ties around the head. With the pleated face masks, I have found they need a nose wire to stay firmly in place, and they are 1- a pain to add 2- good ones are hard to get and 3- some people have a hard time with them. I also find there are large gaps on the sides on many people, not optimal for stopping the spread of droplets.  And some people find they collapse against the face when worn for longer times, making them uncomfortable. So I have been on the lookout for something as simple to make as the pleated mask, but better fitting.\nTake a look at this mask: https://aplat.com/blogs/shus-notebook/diy-cloth-face-mask\nAdvantages: Super simple for even a novice seamstress to make, It does not need a nose wire to stay in position. It \"cups\" the face very well, giving a really close fit. When made with 3 layers or a crisp fabric, it doesn't collapse against the face when you breathe. You can insert a coffee filter or similar for extra protection. The ties can be placed in a number of different positions on your head, making it adaptable for many people. It can be made with elastic instead of ties if you prefer.\nTips for mask sewers: 36\" or 42\" shoelaces work perfectly as ties (47\" must be for a really big guy!) Be sure to leave enough space for threading the cord when you  sew the original seams. You can play with the depth of the folds or the distance of the last top stitching from the sides to fit larger and smaller faces.  If interlined or interfaced, no extra filter needed.\nOff to make another \u2013 I have a friend coming to walk with me!\nSue\n",

They do not take the place of social distancing. If you aren't wearing the correct mask you could get COVID-19.\nHere are a few pointers for putting on and taking off a cloth mask:\n    Wash or sanitize your hands before and after putting on and taking off your mask.\n    Place your mask over your mouth and nose.\n    Tie it behind your head or use ear loops and make sure it's snug.\n    Don't touch your mask while wearing it.\n    If you accidentally touch your mask, wash or sanitize your hands.\n    If your mask becomes wet or dirty, switch to a clean one. Put the used mask in a sealable bag until you can wash it.\n    Remove the mask by untying it or lifting off the ear loops without touching the front of the mask or your face.\n    Wash your hands immediately after removing your mask.\n    Regularly wash your mask with soap and water by hand or in the washing machine. It's fine to launder it with other clothes.\nAnd, here are a few face mask precautions:\n    Don't put masks on anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the mask without help.\n    Don't put masks on children under 2 years of age.\n    Don't use face masks as a substitute for social distancing.\nI don't even own a bandana.\n",

At the beginning of the pandemic, I had a few hospital masks bought earlier before pandemic and saved if I needed for car excursions and also had scarves and bandanas to wear in the yard and on walks.  Eventually, I ordered a tightly woven cloth mask with removable filter and additional replacement filters from Etsy. Wish I had ordered more than one mask but wanted to try it first.  It is not a gaiter but what makes it so successful for me is that it is light weight and has a velcro band that fastens behind the head.  It is great because you can remove the ear straps and the mask can remain around the neck.  \nLast Friday was a Double Whammy Day for me.  After four months of strict self-isolation, no 3 1/2 week haircuts nor carryout food,  I bit the bullet and as it turned out, I started the day with an overdue, unsatisfactory kidney doc visit and concluded with my 1st, since early March, haircut appt. with my longtime hair stylist. When stylist said she thought I'd deserted her, I laughed and assured her that when she saw me, she'd know she'd not been deserted.\nI shampooed ahead and drove to the appointment with a wet hand towel draped over hair (like one of the Arabian Knights), wore sunglasses, mask, long sleeved blouse and slacks.  I must have been quite the sight!  We'd made my appt the last of her day and she knew of my virus vulnerability.  I knew I'd have to uncover my face when she cut around ears and we lifted the plastic sheet over the mask which remained around my neck.  I closed my eyes and was stunned Speechless when she proceeded to blow with her Mouth stray hairs around my ears and neck.  Never before had she or any other stylist not used a blow dryer to whish off any stray hair.  I could not get out of there fast enough!  \nAfter drops in eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, a long shampoo and shower, I made only one colossal mistake.  I should have topped off the day with a verrrry stiff drink of Makers Mark or Vodka\u2026(which has more alcohol??? smiles)  Felt like 4 months of precautions blown so might as well indulge with my first carryout dinner order.  My new 14 days of caution will end the day after my birthday.  \nIn the meantime, I will continue wearing my velcro mask in public but as Becky reported, \"the best mask if one that (you or others) use\".  May take a swig of Berringer wine before a trip to the liquor store or Best Buy but hey! Even the best laid plans\u2026.can go awry!   Taking recs for a new neph and stylist; any suggestions????

Mo other objection to bandanas and similar designs is that they are loose at the bottom, therefor of limited use in containing droplets.\nAs far as the knitted neck gaiters, the reason knit fabrics tend to be comfortable to wear, in clothing and masks, is the permeability \u2013 so unless a filter layer is incorporated in the mask, vapor is readily passing through. My knowledge goes back to fiber study days \u2013 the holes created by the knitting process are multi-diemensional, and therefore more permeable than a tightly woven fabric of similar weight. The reason high-quality sheets and quilting cottons are recommended is their high thread count \u2013 400 or more threads per square inch. Doubled or tripled, they are even better.\nThe other reason gaiters rend to be less useful is that they don't fit firmly near the nose due to the stretch factor, again allowing more vapor to escape.\nSue\n",

The hospitals, clinics and dentist offices are still insisting that patient-facing staff who wear them make them last at least all day, if not for multiple days at a time. When they were used per-Covid, masks were discarded and replaced between patients in infectious situations (like with MRSA patients or immuno-compromised patients.) \nOther masks that tested well (not quite as good as N-95) were surgical masks (the multi-layer disposable type) and cloth masks made of multiple layers of tightly woven cotton or cotton blend fabrics. Masks that did a poor job of keeping droplets from spreading were bandanas and the \"gaiter\" type or other masks made of fleece or knit fabric.\nWe wear 3-layer clothe masks for everyday use, we have several different styles, with different type of ties/elastic depending on how they will be used on a particular day. We also have a small supply of N-95 masks which we use when exposed to soil due to lung issues. We are safeguarding those to use in case one of us becomes ill. \nIt must also be noted that masks are ONLY effective if they cover your face snugly from above the nostrils to the chin so as little vapor escapes as possible. Also, a mask that becomes wet from your breath should be replaced with a clean, dry one as wet masks are not as effective. Discard the soiled mask or bag it for washing & wash or sanitize your hands after handling it. Reusable masks should washed very frequently by hand or machine. Air drying is fine \u2013 the soap & water kill the virus. After a day of errands or visiting with my kids/grands, we may have as many as 6 masks to wash.\nSue\n",

One child has serious asthma and another parent is also a physician.  The parents talked and set short play times outdoors.  \nOf course, we don't know to what degree the children/families at hockey and football practice were restricting activities but tennis was one on one with the instructor and our 15 yr old has been very responsible and not complaining so we thought football would be safe with no contact but just drills like what happened with the hockey group.  \nLuckily, symptoms have not increased and he is \"living\" in the full basement with mom sleeping in the basement guest room.  The trick will be to prevent family spread and of course, all the family is staying home.  I'm sure many, even when told by the health dept. to quarantine for 14 days are not doing so.  This lack of respect for others is what drives me up the wall and will extend the virus spread for everyone.\nSue, Thank you.

For a concerned out-of-state grandmother, your support and kind responses truly help.  \nThe word: \"connect\" is defined by Webster as \"to bind, to fasten, to join\". To associate with others experiencing serious health issues who can share and support with possibly different approaches but with mutual respect in a \"safe\" place is the single most important tenet of the Mayo Support forums.  Thank you.\nMy dad, who was a life role model for me, told me many times over my growing up years that: \"if you can't say something nice, say nothing\".  I've tried to live by that and would suggest that some would be better served if they adopted that as a mantra, too.\n",

So good to read that the Phoenix transplant team did a great job and because of them, and the donor of course, vbg, you are still with us!\nHow very sad that your wife of 14 years declared \"I didn't sign up for this\" and you parted ways.  Unfortunately, her choice is one that happens all too frequently in marriages when one becomes seriously, chronically ill.  I regret that you had to contend with this major life upheaval in addition to dealing with your frightening and debilitating liver condition.  You didn't \"ask\" for the liver problem either!  Glad you soldiered on and hope you are managing your new life much better now.  \nI deliberated about whether or not to include our boys' sporting activities and realized upfront that by doing so, I was letting my family and myself in for possible criticism for decisions made.  There was a temptation to leave that out but instead, I opted for full disclosure, mainly Because this family had taken self-quarantine precautions so seriously from the outset. They deliberated for weeks before reaching their decisions.  Fully aware of the risks of exposure but also facing serious health issues for the little guy by continued absolute isolation.  My sharing was a cautionary tale written as a thought provoker for other families weighing similar choices.  \nWhat you wrote is so very true: \" It is the mistakes that we make when we let down our defenses that will take down the best of us. Being hyper vigilant wears on us all. We are in a battle for survival and will not be able to truly relax until this is over. This is a wake up call for all of us.\" \nI particularly needed to be reminded of that right now.  I am so very weary of self-quarantine and feel so utterly out-of-sync with nearly everyone else in my immediate world that I've started wondering if I am the \"elephant in the room\" while everyone else seems to be living lives as before.  Connect has become even more important to me at this juncture because I need to associate with others who are also taking this killer seriously.\nI, too, have now taken very scary calculated risks by shopping three times during the sr. hour at Walmart. From early March until July 4th, I depended on grocery home delivery exclusively and my car's gas gage remained at 1/2 full.  Last week, dressed like a mummy,  I finally risked getting it topped off.  My state is listed daily among the top 5 with highest new daily virus outbreaks and hospitalizations.  I knew this was coming and decided if I was to prevent running out of necessities entirely to take the chance beginning July 4th because I think the virus numbers are just getting started in my locale.\nYou are so right that Sue and our other mentors are the best of the best.  Our country would be well served to have them in national, state and local political decision making positions but selfishly, I am grateful to have their wise counsel here\u2026smiles. \nThe last two sentences of your post brought on the best royal laugh I've experienced in weeks!  I cannot thank you enough for that!!!  And by-the-by, you are not the first to write or say what you did which makes it all the merrier for me. wink, wink. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you wrote and how you expressed what you did, especially the last.  I'll be smiling about that for days.   P.S. For years my parents questioned how this firecracker came into their lives.  Had it not been that I was the only newborn in the tiny hospital at the time, I feel sure they would have tried to trade me in for another model.  Best.\n",

        "content": "@jdlogan65 & @fiesty76  I am going to weigh in here with a slightly different question/perspective.\nWhat does the Covid-19 world look like to a 10 year old, a 14 year old or a 4 year old, compared to how it looks to someone 50, 60 or 70?\nWe are able to listen to the news and understand what is going on, but it provokes anxiety in even the most mellow of us. We have lived through 9/11, numerous wars, HIV/AIDS, so we have context for catastrophe. If a child or a teen watches, they see frightening images, death statistics, and riots in the streets, with no personal context for understanding.\nMany of us have health risks that make us more aware and more cautious, and we know people personally who have been infected, and perhaps have died of Covid. Not so with kids \u2013 they keep hearing \"It's safe for kids to go back to school\" and \"Kids don't get really sick from this\". Then they see their \"heroes\" \u2013 pro athletes, being allowed to go back to their sports, further confusing the message. We are able to understand the possible long-term consequences of even a moderate infection with organ damage and chronic issues appearing \u2013 again not so with kids.\nAll kids understand is they have been pulled out of school and made to stay home for months, have tried distance-learning, can't play sports or see their friends, and are living with adults whose own stress levels are \"off the charts\" \u2013 especially if they are still working from home, or even worse, going to their workplace & risking infection for themselves and their families. \nKids' mental and physical health are suffering. They are regressing in behaviors and academics, exhibiting anxiety and depression. There is only so much \"at home\" stimulation even the most dedicated parents can provide when all of the resources they usually use are off-limits \u2013 museums, zoos, libraries, fairs, sports, even the local playground or pool. For many families, the state their kids are in is truly alarming. In desperation, parents look for the \"least bad\" choices, make their decisions, and move forward. \nI am giving fiesty's daughter and son-in-law a \"pass\" on this one \u2013 they looked at infections in their area (low), the risk levels of the activities (moderate, if stated precautions were taken) and the need to allow their kids to do something normal (high), and made what they hoped was a safe decision. Sadly, in this case, it didn't work out. On the other hand, my next door neighbors made the decision \u2013 for many of the reasons stated above \u2013 to allow their 12 year old to go to basketball \"camp\" 1 hour a day for a few weeks, where they strictly followed our state guidelines, and he is fine. And is back to shooting hoops in the yard, running with his Mom or sister & mowing lawn for his Dad \u2013 instead of laying on the couch whining. \nJust food for thought. Please remember, in many places, millions of people will be sending their children off to school soon, and we must not condemn them, just hunker down and protect ourselves. One of the really ugly things about this pandemic is that it is not an equal risk for everyone, so those of us at higher risk must take extra measures to protect ourselves, and those at lower risk must make hard decisions. \nSue\n",

I'm so scared right now that no one will be willing to take control and see if it can be controlled if the whole world participates.

We watch the neighborhood teens and twenty-somethings \"hang out\", playing hoops, sharing snacks and drinks (yikes!) and riding around in cars together \u2013 not a hint of masks or distancing.

I was introduced to this gal's mother, who is a registered nurse, who proceeded to stick her hand out to shake hands with me! She had no mask on, despite government orders. And simple basic precautions. And the same for most of the people there at that Open Air Market. I was not only disappointed I was appalled. So, I won't be going back there. She made the comment \"it's no problem because there have been no cases reported here\".

But often they took the bus or are riding bikes so they can't carry a lot. Our mask mandate only applies inside buildings. So people are legal to not wear masks on the sidewalk. I actually think we need to do a better job with how we put food outside. I did tell our food shelf that I didn't feel comfortable. So I might end up in the kitchen helping with meal preparation.

    "content": "My name is Lindsay I\u2019m 38 and a physician assistant. I most likely contracted Covid from a sick patient I was caring for. I started off symptoms wise with a sore throat and burning chest pain. This followed by almost a week of feverish chills intense body aches and headaches. These symptoms then lessened and the shortness of breathe started. The breathing was worse at night. On the worst night I sat up struggling to breathe all night long which prompted an ER visit.I am seeking discussion and support here because my symptoms have not yet entirely subside after 8 weeks.The shortness of breathe improved slowly over two weeks. I am left with fatigue, dizziness with exertion at times and a racing heart usually every night followed by breaking out in a sweat and chest burning. These symptoms have been present since the shortness did breathe started and only slightly lessen with time. Just when I feel better I will have a rough night. This is how the symptoms have been all along.. a roller coaster.I have had the million dollar work up meaning general labs a ct of my chest an echo of my heart and even wore a heart monitor.My pulmonologist, cardiologist and PCP all have not much to say. Other than to rest.I have overall been very healthy and now find myself unable to get through the day with out lying down and am up many nights with a racing heart and sweats and recurrent mild sob even.I\u2019m seeking to hear from medical professionals or individuals who find themselves with lingering symptoms. I\u2019m not sure what to do next and am worried. I have young kids who I want to live for and my job after 8 weeks grows impatient with me to return to the field of caring with sick Covid patients.",

        "content": "Sorry to hear you and many others are going through this.\nI'm going through something similar, but it's not as bad compared to what you are describing.\nI started with a fever 9 weeks ago. Fever (mild) lasted 3 days, then followed by a few days of green/yellow phlegm, and then few weeks of white phlegm. Worst of all is a few days after the fever I started getting totally sleepless nights. Doctor attributed this to anxiety. Then with the help of melatonin/valeriaan, and a short period of Oxazepam I was able to manage anywhere between 4-7 hours of interrupted sleep a night. I'm waking up every 1-2 hours, sometimes find myself breathing fast upon waking etc\u2026. There is some gradual improvement but still not back to normal. Now I'm mostly just using melatonin.\nI've been quite fatigued as well. Nowhere near by normal energy. I can manage daily activities no problem and even some exercise (walks, bike rides, some light strength exercise etc\u2026.), but if I do too much I feel the effect the next day or 2. I'm even going into work on average 3 a week for the past 4 weeks.\nAlso I'm feeling getting some symptoms of post viral fatigue such as sore throat, light muscle ache, slight runny nose etc\u2026 I'm really panicked about this as I see that it takes many months or even a year to recover from this.\nAlthough having said the above\u2026..\nDid a blood test and they found I was extremely low on Vitamin D. I guess the result of living in Europe for 1.5 years after living in Australia. Severe Vitamin D deficiency can also cause depression, muscle ache, fatigue etc\u2026.. So I hope this could at least explain a big part of why I haven't recovered. Perhaps getting sick was the trigger that exposed the V. D deficiency. So my fingers are crossed that this will fix at least most of the problem.\n",

Do you have help with the kids?\nAbove advice on Vit D is good. I read daily about this being a factor in severity of illness. When you feel your heart racing at night- what\u2019s your heart rate like? How long does it last? Also, make sure you hydrate well. You lose a lot of fluids and electrolytes with fever. Last year I had the flu and pneumonia and was hospitalized. I was severely dehydrated and even after I was discharged and my weight had not returned to what I would expect. Being a PA you know this, but it sneaks up on you. Pedialyte or similar would help. You should also consider going to ER or similar for hydration- filling up the tank!\nIn my opinion, you should be examined on a regular basis- to make sure heart, lungs and kidneys function well. It is difficult to take care of oneself when you are so sick. Please, stay in touch and post anytime. \n",

I know there are facebook groups that deal with long termers, but I deleted my account there ages ago. There is a terrific Slack \u201cchat room\u201d for want of a better term. There are probably 25-30 chapters devoted to various COVID-19 symptoms and disease trajectory. Many from the US, UK and Canada among others report in. Many of us also report our symptoms daily on a Covid-19 symptom tracker app that will help researchers and the medical field understand the virus better. This is day 85 for me. My symptom onset was April l1th. While the worst of the shortness of breath lasted 2-4 weeks for me when I kept my inhaler clutched in my palm, the feeling of a corset around the torso lasted at least another month. Coming up on 3 months in a few days, I am still struggling with daily temperature spikes. I can just feel something foreign pumping malaise through my system.  My wake up temp. averages 97.9. Each day it shoots up above 99 anywhere up to 100.9. My eyes remain bloodshot and glazed over with black circles beneath, and the fatigue is ever present. The effort to return to a standing position after bending over is Herculean. I am recently able to walk 2.5 miles on the beach slowly on the hard sand. The first 6 weeks or so I was only able to shuffle around the house. I still can\u2019t face steps or an incline. At about 4 weeks, after 3 virtual visits with my PCP and a respiratory evaluation at a clinic, PCP recommended an evaluation at the ER. May 8th I spent 6 hours in a room with the negative pressure air system and underwent a barrage of testing to rule out any other causes for long term fever. Everything was normal. \n",

My two tours in Vietnam left me 100% disabled. My disability consists of PTSD and loss of an eye. I have worked hard over the years since to overcome my acrophobia, which in the past has had me stay at home and completely isolated. I find it ironic that now I have easily fallen back into isolation with the blessings of the V.A. I have been totally isolated without Covid-19 symptoms in my NYC apartment with my 3 cats since March the 8th. I do not have a mask, nor any other protective gear.\nThat being said, this is not why I am writing. For the past several years I have been a consistent blood donor. I donate whole blood about every 2 months or so. The NY Blood Bank  have pleaded with me to make plasma donations. I have shied away from doing so because I do not like anything going into my body. Take what wou want out, but do not put anything back in has been my feeling.\nI am due to donate again at the end of April, and here is my question. Is it unreasonable for me to ask for a Covid-19 test, an antigen test, and a face mask as a condition? If given those 3 things, I would be willing to make a plasma donation, as creepy as that sounds to me. Surely the blood bank would need to know if I am infected, was infected, or am immune. So would I! The blood bank contacts with whome I have spoken with are schedulers, volunteers, and not medical experts. \nAs part of the donation process, after being hooked up, they take several test-tubes of blood for testing. It should be a no-brainer to do the Covid tests along with all the other tests they perform. \nWhat say you medical experts on this list?\nBest regards\n",

To your question: I have had no luck dealing with technical issues speaking directly with \"New York Blood Center\". As an example, I had a Shingles Vaccine 8 days before my last donation. I called the day before to be sure I was able to donate. I was told that if I received Shingrix (non live) vaccine, I was good to go. When I arrived to donate there was much confusion. At first they would not take blood from me. They did not seem to know the difference between the different types of Shingles Vaccines, and were adamant about my not being able to donate. Only after they spoke to their medical director and to my Doc was I allowed to donate. They may very well be testing for Covid-19, at least I hope so! I don't think it unreasonable to be informed of the test results, in fact, it could be life-saving. Given my age and my COPD, it is a big risk for me to even leave my apartment, which I have not done for over a month. I \"believe\" that by law, if my tests turn up some problem, like AIDS for instance, they must inform me. What feedback I do get from them is an email stating that my blood was used at this facility or that for a particular use, I.E. save an accident victim or some such thing. That tells me that I am disease free. Now, with this pandemic afoot, things are a bit more complicated and dire, and the need to know details is more important than ever.

Like you, as a sr with several chronic health issues, including chronic bronchitis, I have been self-quarantined for over 30 days.  Blood donation was something I did regularly for a long time but stopped a yr. before the virus because of health issues.\nI live in a much less populated area of TX. However, my close friend living in Queens fears leaving her condo because of health issues.  I just want to salute your willingness and also your attempts to get more information from the NY Blood Center.  \nMy friend is becoming increasingly alarmed about the huge delays between placing an online food delivery order and even making the list; when she does get the order placed, the wait time given has been over 30 days. She doesn't drive and her neighborhood grocers and mkts are closed.  Are you experiencing something similar?  Off topic I know but I am deeply concerned for you, her and all living in NYC and the other hotspots springing up in our country. \n",

Platelets twice a month and plasma every 28 days. When I donate  platelets they use an apheresis machine that removes the platelets and plasma and returns the red blood cells. Covid isn't transmitted through blood. As I understand it only transmittable diseases are tested for like\nHepatitis B & C\nSyphilis\nHIV 1 & 2 Antibody testing\nZika virus\nWest Nile virus, and a number of others. I believe West Nile is only tested in certain situations but I\u2019m not sure.\nThe employees at the American Red Cross where I donate are checked every day for any sign of illness as are all the donors as you know. Do you donate at the Red Cross? Everyone there was wearing a face mask, I didn\u2019t see anyone with a shield or a gown. Why are you concerned about them replacing your red blood cells and platlets?

What I have done is go to their websites one minute past midnight day after day. Finally I was able to find one delivery slot 8 days out. On arrival, about 1/2 of my order arrived. Everything else was \"Sold Out\". I have repeated this a couple of times, and now have a months supply of food for me and the cats. I have Masks and gloves on order from Amazon, with delivery dates of May 24th! My biggest issue to date, after food, is getting my garbage out. The only way to the basement, where the garbage is disposed of is only accessible by the building elevator. Which, is small, only 5 foot square. So, I have been using creative methods of storing it till I can get some protective gear to safely take it out. I have been locked-in since March 8th, but the isolation is not an issue for me since I have isolated in similar fashion for years due to mental issues. What was an unhealthy mental condition has turned into an asset sorry to say. I am horribly dismayed and embarrassed at the total failure of my country's response to this fight.  \n",

The first type, a diagnostic test, is used to find out if you are actively infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. This test typically is done as a nasal swab. The second type of test is a serologic test to determine if you had a recent infection of SARS-CoV-2 and now have antibodies against the virus. This test is done through a blood sample.\nDr Poland explains the need for two different tests and how they will help move recovery from the pandemic forward.\nNote: To practice safe social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, this interview was conducted using video conferencing.

        "content": "@cindiwass I'll add a bit to what @merpreb had to say \u2013 Everything about Covid-19 is new and more is NOT known for sure than is known at this time. All aspects of the virus are being studied in teaching hospitals and universities worldwide, but much of what the \"talking heads\" (including many \"experts\" being interviewed) in media have to say is based on the tiniest snippets of a news release. The best way to get good information is to look for peer-reviewed research-based information. Here is one good place to start: https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/category/covid-19/\nAs to the news you were referring to, you may be confusing two pieces of info that have been circulating in the media this week. The first, whether one can be reinfected, is speculation based on the fact that Covid-19 is a Corona class virus, like the common cold. It is possible to become reinfected with a cold virus (perhaps a mutated version of the original one you had) so there is thought you MIGHT be able to be reinfected with Covid-19. It is being studied at the U of MN and other places now. No conclusions have been reached.\nThe second, about Covid-19 in feces, is based on a study of toilet flushing that showed fecal matter can \"aerosolize\" and float in the air when the toilet is flushed. There has been NO evidence yet of viral transmission in this manner. The solution is to close the lid before flushing to contain any droplets, which will then fall harmlessly back into the toilet. If there is no lid, don't lean over the bowl while it is flushing \u2013 push the lever and turn away. \nAs with all things Covid-19 related, the risk of infection is all about the combination of proximity, time, and amount of exposure. The way to limit those is distance, handwashing, and limiting time of exposure. Here is an excellent, if long, interview with a respected epidemiologist about staying safe: https://www.bluezones.com/2020/06/covid-19-straight-answers-from-top-epidemiologist-who-predicted-the-pandemic/ \nI hope these bits of information help ease your mind.\nSue\n",

        "content": "@cindiwass I think current research, once published about length of time of exposure + quantity of virus required, will begin to set our minds at ease a bit. Dr Michael Osterholm, a respected epidemiologist, has convened a task force of varied experts to compile & review all the data on aerosol transmission \u2013 they expect to have preliminary conclusions within 30 days.  \nThat said, based on what we already know, a single touch of the face pretty surely won't transfer enough viable virus particles to infect you. And remember \u2013 virus particles are like barnacles, not flies \u2013 they stay where they land, and cannot move on their own. So if they are on your face, the only way to get into you mouth or nose is if you put them there by putting fingers in eye, nose or mouth. What I do is open the car door, use hand sanitizer before I get in the car, remove my mask, and sanitize again after I remove it \u2013 that way I avoid putting any virus from hands onto steering wheel, controls, etc. \nFor those of you wearing gloves \u2013 PROPERLY remove and discard gloves before getting in the car \u2013 otherwise all the contamination on the gloves comes along with you.\nSee:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/poster-how-to-remove-gloves.pdf\nThey are meant for single use and disposal, not to be taken on & off. If you cannot do this, you are better off without gloves and using handwashing/hand sanitizer. If you put on gloves when you leave home, go on your errands without removing, and take them off when you get home, you are carrying virus from place to place, into your car, and back home again.\nRemember that the main vector of infection is inhalation, so caution about going to the dentist is reasonable because we sit with mask off and mouth open. However, before reopening, our dental office improved their ventilation, and are taking the added precaution of alternating room use, so they don't have two patients back-to-back in the came cubicle. So I do feel safe going (first morning appt.)\nPlease folks, don't put off necessary lab work and doctor's appointments for chronic conditions based on fear, otherwise the long-term effects of this pandemic will be even worse! Use video appointments when possible, early-morning lab visits for safety, wear your mask & wash your hands.\nStay calm, stay safe.\nSue \n",

I've been retired from the marketplace for several years and have adjusted to a much more solitary and less social way of life.  However, with the stay-in-place that so many of us are thankfully! adhering to now, I also feel more like a sleepy slug than a motivated marvel!  \nAt 76 yrs, I've Never been a fan of being told: \"I must; I should\".  My inner rebel child wants to strike back and say or think:  hmmm, well we'll see about that.  vbg  However, in this extraordinary time of present and future uncertainty, I am thankful for the scientists and infectious disease docs who warn and caution us to all distance ourselves and take necessary precautions to prevent the spread of this invisible enemy.  \nA close friend seems very preoccupied with worries about how life will be changed in the future. lol  I tell her it is enough for me to decide how many days I can wait before emptying my snail mailbox out on the street curb.  Another friend in NYC is increasingly and understandably concerned about leaving her multi-family high rise condo to take the elevator down to the floor of the communal mailbox room. \nFrankly one of my greatest concerns is that too many folks will begin resuming their \"before virus\" jobs and lifestyles before this devil is brought under better control.  When tests can show quickly that people are not infected or are well from the virus, I'll be very encouraged to see those people gradually re-entering the non-essential workforce.  Until then, I plan to \"stay put\" and work at finding ways of stretching the food and supplies I have on hand.  \nIt is good to hear that someone like you, who is accustomed to working a regular business day from home, is also finding that these new restrictions are making you feel less productive.

I assume that most of the population faces the same situation as suburban Minnesota \u2013 schools are at or over capacity, with no funds for additional construction, so social distancing is impossible. Consider that we cannot gets adults to do it \u2013 how do you enforce it among children and teens in a full-house setting?\nThis is a constant topic in our family \u2013 my daughter is the school nurse in a high school of 2500 students (built for 2000) and parent of 2 preschoolers. The district includes 33000 students in 33 buildings, roughly 10% of them with chronic health issues making them vulnerable. As well, many of the teachers and staff are over age 50 or with health issues, bus drivers are primarily retirees, and the pool of available subs is largely composed of retired teachers. The district has already announced that they cannot get (read will not try to get) any type of PPE for staff or students \u2013 even their nurses.\nParents are insisting the schools open because distance education is too hard, they cannot afford daycare, and that \"kids don't get very sick anyway.\" To make matters more difficult, many on staff and many parents are insisting that masks are not an option \u2013 \"kids can't see facial expressions\" \"too hard to breathe\" \"who will provide\" etc.\nSchool districts here are working overtime this summer trying to figure out what they are going to do, all while watching the numbers of case to see what is even possible. They are requiring each district, using state guidelines, to have 3 plans in place by August 1st \u2013 all in-person, hybrid, and all-distance. \nAs with everything Covid, stay tuned for further developments.\nSue\n",

It's hard enough for them to wash their hands, let alone wear masks when they were never required to do so in their lifetime. Older children often push the boundaries to assert their independence. I read that in Alabama, college kids are having covid party, those who are infected go to parties on purpose and see who get infected next. Such mentality is scary. It's not easy for parents who are now working at home to take care of young children at the same time.  In Japan, the found that child abuse cases had gone up since the pandamic.\nI'm grateful my grandchild is only 2, and he doesn't really understand the situation yet. He wore  a mask the whole time when I went to see him for a brief moment. My son, daughter in law and myself all wore masks and sat outside in a safe distance. The sad part is I don't get to hug him. He should be running around in the park, on a jungle gym and learn to swim, but all that are on hold.\nHe's missing alot too.\nEducation is so very important, my friend's granddaughter is due to report to college, and although they set a date in September to start school, it is still subject to change. \n",

The number of positive tests in a state is not equal to the number of cases, as one person may be tested more than once. It would appear that the people you are talking with are confusing the terms \"test\" vs. \"case.\"\nSee this information:\n\u2013 CDC https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html\nThere are certainly limitations to the data being collected and it varies from state to state. Rather than an over-calculation of cases, it is more likely than there are more cases than are being reported since not everyone is symptomatic and not everyone is getting tested.\nFrom Johns Hopkins\n\"Since confirmed case numbers may be dependent on how much testing a state is doing, it is also important to see how many tests have occurred in each state. If people who are infected cannot get tested, they will not be counted as a confirmed case in the state\u2019s data.\"\n\"When states report the number of COVID-19 tests performed, this should include the number of viral tests performed and the number of patients for which these tests were performed. Currently, states may not be distinguishing overall tests administered from the number of individuals who have been tested. This is an important limitation to the data that is available to track testing in the U.S., and states should work to address it.\"\nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-faq/overview#why-are-there-inconsistencies-among-testing-data-for-covid-19\nIdeally, each state should be calculating tests vs. cases as this graph from Johns Hopkins shows:\nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/states-comparison\n",

But if positive, and you are in the system already as positive, you will not be counted again, although they are beginning to maintain a database of people who test positive, then negative, and later positive again (very rare.) \nAlso (in MN) positive results are tracked by city/county of residence, not location of test site.

We had scheduled our annual celebration lunch for the following Monday.  The shock was indescribable.  This one was long predicted and the daily changes that occurred made most of the focus on the newest situation.\nThe funeral plans have just been finalized and my order for catering the afterward luncheon for attendees has been placed.  The daughter's decision for a chapel service means I and some others who also have serious health issues will not be attending.

        "content": "First of all let me offer you condolences in the loss of your friend, I have a very special minister friend that once told me \"words on a page somehow and sometimes get loss in their meaning\" and I find that sometimes true. It is hard to express one's true feelings and how they will be received by the person on the other end. However that said your writing was from the heart and so expressive and know that just by your writing you have already and will touch so many other people. Some people have the gift of expressive writing and you are one of those people. \nI lost my sister, pre COVID, and we used to call each other and could talk for hours on the phone, when one day I called and my brother-in-law told me that she was not doing well that she was sleeping allot. That was last Spring and ever since that day we were not able to have a \"real conversation\", than after many doctors appointment, and because of HIPAA I was not able to truly find out what her real problem was, I had to sit back and just take in what others were telling me, and being a nurse that was so hard for me to experience. I felt that there was nothing that I could do. Fortunately I was able to see her before she died and she knew that I was there but as for a \"real\" conversation that was gone. I feel so blessed that this happened last year and not now as COVID has changed so many things for so many people.\nWhat I hear you saying and forgive me if I am wrong is that I hear you struggling with how are you expected to grieve and mourn, this is all so out of our normal, and yes, for so many of us this is, whether it be the death of a loved one, or all of the changes that we are going through. We cannot conduct our lives like we used to, at least for some of us that want to and need to remain safe. I keep going back to Kubler Ross and the stages of grief, allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you are feeling now and in the future. Don't let anyone tell you how to grieve or how long to grieve, let herself go through all of the stages, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Please allow yourself to cry, allow yourself to feel whatever it is that you are feeling and don't feel like you have to be anything different. I hear you when you say \"she always had your back\", she was always someone that you could go to, someone to laugh with and talk over any important or trivial moment, that for you is gone. I feel your pain. I can remember our parents who used to lose their family and friends one by one, I used to think \"how sad\", BUT until one experiences it for one's self it doesn't make if \"real\" until you, yourself have those shoes on your feet. \nThere is a saying in life, \"we come into this life alone and we go out of this life alone\", and that is true, but somehow it rings hollow, we are not meant to live alone, we are meant to be in community, to share, to love. and to hold/hug. For right now you are feeling alone and I wish I could be there for you, just to have another human being by your side, we do not know each other, but just to have another human being to be there for you, just a physical presence, someone to listen to you, not having to say anything but just to be there. But I am going to share something with you, I have lost loved ones in my life and what you are feeling right now is \"real\", it is raw, it hurts, and seems like it will never change or get better. But I have also found that with time, that softens, does it ever go totally away, no, but it softens and those things that you are feel right now are real, and right now what you are experiencing is \"fresh\", it like a wound that does not have a scab on it, it is not healed. I have heard others say about COVID, that there is no normal right now, that what we used to think of as normal will be no more, that there may be a \"new normal\". I just hope and pray that the new normal does not mean that we forget the past, forget how to be there for each other, that along with some good changes that we do not forget how to love each other and be there for each other. Your reaching out and your expressiveness tells me that you care, that you want to go on but for now that seems all seems to be foreign to you.\nWhat I want to leave you with, is that I hope and pray that you have a spiritual foundation, for me that has been my rock, my \"go to\", and something that can never be taken away from me. No matter what happens to me in my life, I will never be truly alone, I will have God to turn to, He is the one that is always there, and will always listen. No, I can't pick up the phone and actually talk to Him, but what I can do and can feel is HIs presence in my life, He is my true friend, my true comforter, and my source of peace. So fiesty 76, I send you my \"words on this page\", and want to tell you that God will always have your back. May you find peace, comfort, and hope for your tomorrow.\n",

You experienced a similar closeness with your DNA sister before her death that sounds so much like the relationship my \"sister-of-the-heart\" and I shared.  \nDuring an earlier hospitalization, I was with my friend and her guy in the hospital daily and as a result, could hear directly from and communicate with her docs and medical team.  Her second hospitalization occurred during covid and unable to visit, I, like you, had to rely on her guy's often overwhelmed and confused explanations.  \nAs a long time primary caregiver for several family members, Kubler Ross's, five stages of grief, as well as other books on grief over the years have provided insight and help.  I suppose right now I am most experiencing anger at the unnatural daily life we are all experiencing and contending with because the pandemic has irrevocably disrupted and dismantled the most basic human actions one would otherwise take.  For me, the inability to be physically present with my friend and her guy has been the single hardest challenge to manage and accept. \nWhat a lovely way to convey how grief over time, while never going away completely, does \"soften\" with the passage of weeks and months.  Thank you for that reminder.  Religious beliefs can especially provide a bedrock of comfort and while faith services and practices have radically been modified or curtailed in some instances, relying on a power greater than our own is more beneficial now than ever before.\nThank you for taking the time and empathy to share this very meaningful post.  I will be re-reading yours along with the other caring responses shared here in the days ahead.  \nMy first Mayo Connect chronic health group has provided me with so much continuing information and help.

Thank you.  \nEach time I'd visit my family home and as members were added to our family plot, regardless of the primary reason for any visit, I always made it a priority to spend time at the cemetery communing with my loved ones. Those visits throughout the years brought me much comfort and consolation regardless of whatever else was going on in the family.  With the completion of estate affairs for my sister, there are no others of that family group living to require a trip back to my hometown.

Instead declared that she will carry them home with her and have them made into some type of necklace.  I am beyond despair at her disregard for her mom's expressed/desired plans and wishes.  At least she referenced Fred as companion in the obituary as well as the brothers, she did not include the names of their wives because she \"never liked them\".  \nI'd delivered a letter, which included some possible tribute remembrances that might be used during the service to Fred along with a batch of his favorite chocolate chip cookies and a can of his favorite reg. Coke the other day about 6am.  Parked in front of a neighbor's house and posted a note on his garage window of the \"pkg\" left.  Didn't want to alert anyone of the delivery and though he shared what I wrote with daughter and said it had \"made his day\", I seriously doubt any of it will be read at the service today.  It was primarily intended for him and my friend knew how much she was loved by so many. \nAs my friend so often said: \"This too shall pass\" and although I cannot be there to physically support him today, we will have other times ahead to share.\nEven knowing that the daughter's unreasonable behavior is a manifestation of her untreated mental illness, I know the best action for me is to avoid any and all possible contact with her.

Unfortunately, it's more complex. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, doesn't only affect the lungs. \nBronchoalveolar lavage or lung lavage is primarily used as a diagnostic tool. This test has been used to diagnose cases of COVID-19. See these studies as examples:\n\u2013 Diagnosis of COVID-19 by Bronchoalveolar Lavage after Two Negative Nasopharyngeal Swabs https://cjgim.ca/index.php/csim/article/view/449\n\u2013 Bronchoalveolar lavage findings in severe COVID-19 pneumonia https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7225401/\nLung lavage has been used successfully as a treatment for a rare lung disease called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). But lung lavage does not work for all lung conditions. It works well for PAP because of the nature of the disease, but it could actually cause challenges with other conditions, such as COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. It is currently not a treatment for COVID-19 that I know of.\n",

My wife went to the hospital to check but was not allowed to go past the lobby. There was a sign on the door that said, \"Stop! No visitors!\" My wife was able to speak to a nurse and make sure that a doctor was monitoring the situation. Last we heard, Mom was doing better.\nIf I may make a very mundane suggestion, it would be that hospitals should try to make sure that patients can charge their cellphones and any devices that can connect with whatever WiFi is available. In my recent experience I have noticed that some hospitals don't seem to care if patients can do this, and it can make a patient feel quite isolated and helpless if they cannot communicate with family or other acquaintances. I know most facilities have landline phones in their rooms, but in this day and age, who has memorized more than one or two important phone numbers?  \nI was hospitalized last April and not only did my cellphone battery go dead but the battery in my hearing aid died and I did not have a replacement. The hospital had no devices to charge the phone, and it refused to supply me with a new hearing aid battery or allow me to buy a new pack from the pharmacy next door. This put me in a situation where I was not only deaf but I could not communicate with my family to ask one of them to bring me a hearing aid battery and phone charger. Luckily, when I was in the emergency room waiting to be admitted I asked a nurse for a pen and paper so I could write down family phone numbers before my phone battery was exhausted. A nurse called my mother \u2014 the same one who is now hospitalized \u2014 and got her to bring me a charger and pack of batteries. My mom can barely walk 30 feet on a good day, and the hospital more or less shamed her into getting a Lyft and bringing me these essential items in person. \n",

As a nurse who worked in many stressful situations,  I would suggest that you have a small notebook so you can record everything that happens. This way you won\u2019t have to rely on your memory when you\u2019re upset. Record nurses names and dates they were assigned to your husband. If you witness anything, record it also. Record doctors names, ask for their business cards.  Record names and times of medications, etc.\n I know that being in a hospital, especially an ICU, is overwhelming and foreign.  Sometimes, what looks strange and upsetting to a family, is not. It\u2019s just different. Tasks are done faster because they have to be done faster. Right now, with this virus situation, nurses, especially, are under a lot of pressure.\nSince your husband may have to stay at this hospital, do your best to get to know the staff and let them know you also.  But, mostly, focus on your husband. He needs to know that you are there and that you care.  If I can help with anything, let me know\n",

I am glad you shared your experience even though I understand how difficult that was to do.\nThis group understands better than many casual acquaintances, friends or neighbors how critical health situations can bring out both the worst and best in those closest to us.  \nMy best friend is home with Hospice care.  Her daughter came to stay and take over her mom's medical and quality of care needs.  Sadly, her mom gave her both legal and medical powers of attorney long before my friend's loving guy of 20+ years came into her life. Now the daughter is creating havoc in the home, attempting to take over financial matters and threatening that either \"he or I need to move out of the house\".  I advised immediate counsel with an attorney and although they made an appointment, they cancelled it when the Hospice team scheduled a home conference because of the daughter's behavior.  My friend owns the home where they reside and only she can order her daughter to leave.  While she has told the daughter that her guy \"stays\", she is unwilling to order her to leave.\nIt is more than enough pain to bear witnessing what you and they are experiencing.  I am so thankful that your deep religious faith is bolstering your ability to continue to manage and remain strong in the knowledge that your husband knows of your enduring love. \nSupport is the name of the game in this Connect group.

She had recently divorced and wanted access to my sister\u2019s trust fund.  I learned of her action when given notice of a hearing before a judge.  I was advised to write a letter to the judge.\nThat was an incredibly difficult task for me to attempt. Stunned and overwhelmed by her action, my first drafts included more of the emotions I was feeling and fewer of the facts that needed to be included.\nIt took a few starts, set asides and new starts before I felt confident that the content was solely factual data and not emotional reaction.  As Becky wrote: \u201cby continuing to revise so that just the facts remained\u201d, the judge dismissed the case in my favor.\nThe first step is always the hardest and it took me numerous drafts but Nikki you can do this, even if a few sentences at a time.

After that, he stopped answering the phone and when i call the nurses station they say they don't have anyone listed under that name. Seems like they are divorcing us honestly.

        "content": "I would like to report that many things are open here in Minnesota, with more being added each week, but we continue to see many people wearing masks even though not mandatory- probably because our leaders model it routinely. Now comes the time to make hard decisions \u2013 when to venture back out into the world, to what extent, and what precautions to take to remain healthy.\nHere are my observations, from trips to two grocery stores, pharmacy, my hairdresser, 3 doctors, 3 garden centers and a couple of necessary retail stops this week and last:\n\u2013 Everyone at the clinics were wearing masks, but a few patients had them dangling below their noses. Temperatures taken & questions asked in the entryway, before admission. Sanitizing all spaces between patients.\n\u2013 90% of our retail workers are wearing masks, and most places are sanitizing carts, counters & credit card machines between customers. Almost every place had shields installed at registers, many had one-way aisles and barricades to control traffic. I have decided to not patronize any stores where they are not wearing masks & sanitizing, because I figure unprotected people who deal with the public all day are PRIME candidates to spread the virus \u2013 in fact I immediately walked out of any store where the employees were not masked.\n\u2013 My hairdresser is in a solo salon, being extremely cautious because she herself has health risks. She is following CDC/State guidelines for sanitizing, health checks, masks for all\u2026I felt perfectly safe there. My sister goes to a chain salon \u2013 she won't be going back soon, because she said it seemed like each stylist was following only those rules she wanted to \u2013 leaving everyone in the place at risk.\n\u2013 In the garden centers (mainly outdoor facilities), nearly all workers wore masks, they had distancing & one-way paths marked, but few customers in masks, so I stayed outdoors, kept my distance and got out of there as fast as I could \u2013 no leisurely strolls to \"see what's new.\"\n\u2013 At least 60% of shoppers in stores where masks are not required do wear them \u2013 primarily the older people and the milennials, but not so much the teens or those between 40-60??? In the hardware store, seems like most of the tradespeople also wear them, my contractor brother thinks it's because they are used to wearing masks for dusty jobs, and are expected to wear them in peoples' homes and most businesses.\n\u2013 The worst place was my pharmacy \u2013 one pharm tech came in from lunch, put on her mask, and started waiting on customers without sanitizing hands, the other had no mask in evidence \u2013 went to complain to the manager, and she had no mask either. Walked out irritated, and will look for a new pharmacy\u2026\nI'm still not ready to sit down and eat in a restaurant, but we have been picking up takeout food from our favorite local eateries all along. Our church is not yet resuming in-person services (both pastors and many members are high risk, and they would have to have a lottery to figure out which of us would be allowed in anyway.)\nFinally, I have been regularly hitting the less-popular local parks and walking paths on weekdays since the stay-home order lifted. It is easy to maintain distance, and great to see other people \u2013  have had some lovely conversations with strangers, sitting on adjacent park benches. I wear a mask, or have it handy, depending on the amount of people around. \nJust so you know \u2013 through all of this, I have worn a mask, washed & sanitized my hands until they are like sandpaper, and sanitized my poor car repeatedly. Yesterday I had a presurgery covid-19 test, and it came back negative.\nSo, with some careful observation of how each business operates, wearing a mask, social distancing & good hand hygiene, sticking to slow times or senior hours, and avoiding the obvious more dangerous places, it seems is possible to safely get back out in the world a little bit. \nWhat is everyone else doing these days?\nSue\n",

It's great to see them again.\nMy daughter gave me a much needed hair cut and she did it better than my hairdresser! They cooked paella on Saturday. I helped her with her sewing machine problem. On Sunday we had a prime rib take out dinner from a private club they belong to. We stayed in the car and they loaded the meals in boxes in the trunk. We still have masks on, and they did too. This was my first beef meal in 6 months!! This week they will get fish from an Alaskan fisherman , most likely halibut, and regular veggies delivery from local farm. I am so spoiled.\nShe has also started a vegetable and herb garden. The herbs are growing really well, except something is eating the dill seedlings. Her fig trees are full of figs, not ripe yet. She said when it gets close to being ripened, the squirrels or birds would start making small bites on each of them to find a ripe one and she ended up nothing. She tried putting a net over it but it didn't help.

        "content": "@jack32 & @johnbishop   I know John invited me in here for a reason \u2013 maybe because I always say \"Stay tuned for further developments.\"\nI am going to play the skeptic here \u2013 it's WAY too early to pay attention to any \"preliminary studies.\" There are far more unknowns and speculations than facts, and even this week two early reports from The Lancet have been withdrawn pending further review. Because of the newness of this virus, there are no results available yet from unbiased, controlled studies done over a reasonable period of time and then peer-reviewed, which is the gold standard for research studies. \nThere are only reports of what has been observed in people who got the virus. The problem with those reports is that we still don't understand who is more likely to get the virus. We do have some indication that certain factors like age, obesity, and diabetes make complications from Covid-19 more likely if you get it. And there are indications that the closeness and duration of exposure make getting the virus more likely.\nFor now, when considering how much weigh to give any study, consider the following:\nIs the study \"observational\" only, or is it an intentional, controlled study?\nWhere is it being reported, the general media or a scientific journal?\nHow many people or places does the study cover, and how many doctors/scientists/institutions not otherwise afiliated with one another are part of the study?\nAre the same results being reported independently in multiple studies?\nWas the study peer reviewed before publication?\nFor myself, I consider an observational study, not peer reviewed and reported in the media  to be \"not ready for prime time\" and I await confirmation as outlined . If it is true that people with A+ blood get more complications, it will be further studied and reported. Or it may be determined that those people are more susceptiple to getting a certain disease or illness, and that underlying illness predisposes one to more severe Covid-19 or more complications.\nThe best strategy at this point is to do what John says and follow precautions based on your personal risk factors. Especially, wash your hands frequently and maintain social distance.\nSue\n",

However, it's sometimes hard for me to do this for one being that I also have health anxiety and secondly I think I am blood group A. Also, my health anxiety becomes a bit worst after I was diagnosed with a DVT a few years ago that originally got misdiagnosed as a pulled muscle.  \nSo, last night as I went to bed I read through some news to see if there was any good news and then the first thing that I come across in the headlines is that those with Blood Type A may be more susceptible to getting the virus as well needing treatment in hospitals according to pre-print studies. Now, I had already heard about another study that was done in China which showed a connection between blood types and coronavirus at the beginning of this outbreak. And I remember asking my Doctor about this study (which was a preliminary study by the way) and she told me not to worry too much because almost half of the country I'm in which is the UK is blood group A anyway while blood group O is marginally more common.\nAnyway, As I said, I recently came across more preliminary studies (yet to be peer-reviewed) highlighted in some media articles. These studies involve countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany, Norway, USA, and Russia. Since reading this I have also been struggling to come across any reliable information by medical expert opinions on this so far. A lot of stuff I've come up with is garbage like eathis.com or eureka.com.\nMoreover, according to some of these studies, those with blood group A may have a 50% higher risk of contracting the disease. While those with blood group O may have a 50 % low risk. Also, some theories and observations regarding why people with blood group A may have worse cases of the virus as well as my own thoughts include:\n    Cytokine Storms\n    Excessive Coagulation\n    It was six percent of the blood group A that become more ill.\n    It's not clear whether the genetic markers for this blood type made people more susceptible or actual blood type itself.\n    Almost all the patients in Russia are blood group A although their condition is pretty much stable right now.\n    Several of the other comorbidities associated with Covid-19 as a higher risk is also associated with have blood group A.\n    While blood group A is the second most common blood group it could be that more blood group A people were more exposed (my own thought).\n    This could just be a correlation and there is no causal factor here (my own thought).\n    Either the study or the media said that this could explain why some young people who others otherwise well are becoming seriously ill with the disease. However, it still is a rare occurrence and so can we really conclude that blood groups are playing a role in young and healthy people getting worse cases (a question of mine)?\n    What do we know about the people with blood group A that had the disease but only had mild cases or were asymptomatic? Did the studies only involve people that were in the hospital and not involve anyone of any blood group outside of the hospital? Is this perhaps coincidental?  (Some more queries of mine).\n    If it is the blood group that is responsible then why? Is this because some people with this blood group are more likely to have cytokine storms or excessive coagulation that result in blood clotting as a result of being infected? Is excessive coagulation also a result of an over-reacting immune response? If this is the case then would that mean people with this blood group to be more susceptible to other infections such as Influenza? (More questions of mine)\n    Does this also explain why some people may get Anaphylaxis which I think is something to do with Cytokine Storms as well? Furthermore, does this also mean that those of us that are already on Anti-coagulants for the prevention of DVTs at reduced risk of having a bad case of Covid-19? (More questions of mine)\n",

Typically one who likes to \"delve deeper\" and research various topics or concerns, I initially listened to daily news reports about the spread of COVID-19.  Since I am also an \"easy\" worrier, I have been surprised at how I've managed to not become outlandishly anxious or depressed over these past weeks.  \nHowever, last week both personal and national events, coupled with my community and state throwing the public restart doors wide open, overwhelmed me.  I decided that I needed to take a break from all tv and media news reports.  Regardless of what is happening outside my control, I am spending more time in doing physical things like walks, gardening and indulging in music, books and hobbies that interest and relax me.  My age and conditions haven't changed but the direction I've chosen to spend most of my time is restoring my calm.  Local and state COVID numbers are important to me because they will determine how much longer I will choose to isolate.

Nothing in life is a given, there are no guarantees, and the proverbial \"hit by a bus\" scenario can snuff a person out at any time. I was good to go for however long Covid might isolate, stifle, and hamstring my life. I made living until November third my short-term goal, for what are probably obvious reasons.\nBUT, then this sudden and huge national paroxysm of racism, violence, horror, and uncertainty happened. I too was overwhelmed, once more. My mental boat almost capsized. I felt waves of hatred for my (previously beloved) country, literally quaked with despair, and could think of nothing more than getting to a saner place to finish out my life. Since that is probably not possible, I must again right the boat and carry on. There is so much good in our country, in spite of our glaring problems, I pray that there is hope for us as a continuingly democratic republic.

These times can certainly be frustrating!  \nWhile everyone is different and how we react to change is unique to each of us I've chosen a different way of looking at this.  \nFirst, having lost my wife recently and yesterday losing a longtime friend, I look at our current societal changes as temporary and mostly an inconvenience.\nLikewise, since my wife died I bristle when people talk to me about 'getting back to normal' or asking ' how do you like your new normal'.  Again, just how I look at life, but I believe if we spend time looking at what was normal or looking to get back to normal, we are spending our time and energy on looking back \u2014 not forward in life.  Trying to recapture what was, not looking to what is or will be.  Significant changes in our lives do exactly that \u2014 change our lives.  I look at my life now as different and that makes it a new unknown.  Just as I look at these times as different and not looking back. Sure I miss doing some things, but at the same time I have found far more than what I may have missed.  I've spoken to more friends of old, relaxed, completed more long delayed projects,  written more letters, read, etc. than ever before.\nIt's different, but to me different can be very good \ud83d\ude42\nStrength, courage, and peace\n",

Usually this time of year is crazy-busy for us, and time in the yard and garden is frenzied and geared toward \"getting it done.\" This year, I am looking critically at where plants are, how they grow, whether or not there is a better place for them, whether \"less is more\" in some spaces.\nTo accomplish this:\nYard art has been moved around to show it off and make more interesting views from the patio.\nI have been aggressively marking extra plants and giving them away. Friends and neighbors have been the recipients of a couple hundred extra perennials to grace their yards.\nPlanters and pots have been planted in color themes and deployed to enhance the patio and garden beds. (I usually just plant whatever catches my eye in the greenhouse.)\nThe patio has been thoroughly cleaned & rearranged to make it more relaxing and all the \"hidey holes\" cleared of excess stuff.\nAt the end of each day, I grab a beverage and sometimes a book, and relax on the patio to admire the gardens. \nRediscovering my joy in gardening has been an adventure, and has eased my feelings of loneliness as we continue to distance. As a side benefit, while I work outdoors, my husband has found long-delayed tasks and projects nearby to occupy him, our whole home is improving, and we relax together between tasks, admiring each other's work. Yesterday, as we rested between chores, we figured out how we can safely entertain up to four friends or family members on the patio this summer, which lifted my spirits immensely!\nWhat \"little adventures\" can you find close to home?\nSue\n",

There is nothing \"normal\" about these times for many of us, especially caregivers or those facing the terminal illnesses on those we love.\nThe double whammy of the pandemic arriving simultaneously with facing the end of life for my best friend is cruelly overwhelming for me at times.  As the primary caregiver for years of both my mom and only sister and for a shorter period for my nephew, I was alone in making medical, home health, legal and quality of care decisions.  I thought I'd experienced the full range of emotions every caregiver knows and experiences at one time or another.  However, during those years, I was able to be physically there and actively present with them.  Now with my closest friend of decades I cannot be there for her.\nUntil her most recent release from hospital, I'd been able to actively participate by preparing meals for her and interacting with her medical team and others at her and her guy's request.\nHer last recent hospitalization dismissal and diagnosis that the cancer had become much more aggressive coincided with the Covid-19 outbreak.  My pulmonologist told me in no uncertain terms, unless you self-isolate, contacting the virus will more than likely prove fatal for you.  While that certainly got my attention, it also meant that I cannot see or physically spend time with my friend and her wonderful guy.  \nMy friend had begun signs of dementia prior to her earlier stage 4 metastatic breast cancer diagnosis.  Now, she has great difficulty completing a sentence and that adds such frustration for her.  We try to \"guess\" what she wants to convey but sometimes/often we miss the mark which adds to her stress. \nHowever and although she's been told of her advanced cancer, her memory loss has been merciful in the respect that she cannot remember or realize from day-to-day how critically ill she is.  We communicate daily and I work to recall the wacky, funloving, mischief making, comical times we've shared. She chuckles and can recall them at the moment.  I remind her of the many times she went far beyond the usual friend factor in her support and encouragement of me at critical/crisis times in my life.  I have great difficulty grasping the reality that a time will come when I can no longer hear her precious voice, her laughter.  I am thankful for what we do have but oh, I so wish I could do more.\nScott, Members here can only be inspired and grateful for what you posted above and your many other supportive, encouraging messages.

The first 10 years were spent removing and giving away 14 tons of washed river rock and pulling out landscape fabric so I could have gardens. The next 25 have been spent designing, planting, redesigning, mulching, redesigning, edging, redesigning\u2026\n I do know I'm done expanding and ready to simplify. For example, I'm done with garden \"thugs\" \u2013 as soon as I figure out a plant wants to spread beyond where I want it, out it goes. If it's too much work, out it goes \u2013 so we buy our apples at the orchard now. Last week Russian sage was ruthlessly eliminated from the mailbox bed, where it wants to crowd out the lilies, daylilies and roses. Today as we relaxed and looked at the back fence line, I told my husband the large spectacular clump of one native, the Cup Plant, needs to go because it wants to be The Boss, and even the seedlings are a challenge to remove. Now I get to choose one or two showy shrubs to replace it and find someone with a strong back to dig it out.\nToday another 90 coneflowers, milkweed plants and a few other natives were potted to go to my sister and her son for their gardens, which means the pond garden is nearly finished for this year\u2026except more mulch \u2013 about 20 bags of it.\nTomorrow I tackle the 15' x 100' back garden \u2013 that one takes a solid week to get under control, and probably has another 500 seedlings to share. I don't think I'll even bother to try to get my fingernails or feet completely clean until that's done. Yesterday I even found dirt inside my bra when I went to shower \u2013 my kids used to say I really get into my work.\nI would be going a lot slower except I have exactly 3 weeks until thumb surgery, then I'm out of the garden for at least 6 weeks, and not much good for the next 6. I'm going to hire the 12 year old next door  or my nephew's boys down the road to keep the feeders and birdbaths cleaned and filled,  pond skimmed and filters clean, since all their summer activities have been cancelled \u2013 we'll see which one wants to play in the water most.\nSo Ginger, give yourself a break. Set one or two goals each season, then sit back and enjoy what you've done. Let the land tell you what it wants!

They closed the property off, and were intruding on safe navigation of curved driveway. I like seeing the surrounding hills and feeling the breeze. Hubby mourns their loss, but we will plant some boxwood hedges between the Japanese Burberry still on that driveway fence line. That will be visually pleasing, and offer some privacy.\nSometime next year we will replace the property fence, once we know what direction the vacant lots on two sides will take. If the owner does not sell them outright [he won't sell to us], they go to auction by end of the year. I will be moving the lovely rocks that semi-line that fence. They make keeping a clean line difficult, and some will be used to create my \"directional\" yard feature. Eventually the bigger ones will help on north slope. Someone went to a lot of work and expense to bring these rocks and boulders in. My husband laughs that the first words out of my mouth when we looked at house, \"I hope they are leaving the rocks!\" \nThe biggest challenge I have is finding out what will grow best around here.

I am not surprised to see the change like you show \u2013 remember that yesterday was reflecting weekend numbers, when reporting may not have been at peak efficiency, so today's numbers are perhaps showing the reporting catching up with the reality. Overall, I am heartened to see that the number of new cases reported have \"flattened\" for several days \u2013 hanging at about 20,000 new cases per day, even though it becomes a smaller percentage of total cases reported \u2013 it may indicate that isolation is helping.\nIt will be interesting to see if we begin to see the number of new cases decline as isolation goes on.\nThe second concern I have is that the numbers reported, as alarming as they are, are only test-confirmed cases of the virus. We KNOW there are many people symptomatic but untested due to shortages, so the public needs to assume that this virus is far more common that reported.\nStay calm, Stay home & Stay safe.\nSue\n",

As to the accuracy of the statistics, one of my engineering economic research manager heros taught me that when modeling things any number is better than no number.  Then you can refine the numbers as more information becomes available.  \nI agree that the statistics on coronavirus confirmed cases and deaths are not perfect.  The number of deaths as a percent of confirmed cases keeps rising (now about 5% instead of original 3.4% versus predicted 1-2%).  I think this is due primarily to lack of accurate testing of entire population.  And as you indicate the deaths reported are not 100% accurate as they may be due to the underlying medical issues rather than coronavirus.  However, I do think the statistics are well within the correct order of magnitude and paint a picture of a very serious worldwide pandemic that we all are dealing with,and racing to find safe and effective vaccines and treatments for.  \n",

For example, at one time the elderly or those who are immune-compromised were considered to be the most vulnerable.  Lately, however, children are found to be extremely vulnerable as well. \nThis very complex virus has many different strains.  Here in Michigan, we have at least four different strains of COVID-19, which makes this virus different from all the rest.  Some of these strains appear to be super-spreaders.  In other words, they can spread to others and infect a greater group than other strains.\nI have a great deal of respect for state and national leaders who make policies based on scientific-based knowledge.

He indicated that the drug I was on (valinofaxin) had generic brands started a couple of months previous \u2013 maybe that was what triggered it. But after investigating, I found that I had not been given the generic. So basically had either been on the drug too long, or had developed an allergy to it \u2013 which can happen with anything.But he is such a good doctor, he helped me get off them and is seeing me every month.\n Weaning off the drug was not easy, as I am sure you found as well. But the nausea and vomiting stopped gradually. Each time I reduced my dosage, I would vomit \u2013 weird, huh? I no longer vomit and the nausea has finally stopped as well. So my sister nailed it!\nI have been taking ValeriCalm, which is anti anxiety/sleep aid. Purchase at health food stores. It seems to help. Also, I don't know if you are in Canada or not, but cannabis CBD oil is another one that helps. My heart flutters when anxiety is high, and the CBD oil seems to help that. (It does not have marijuana in it) It is effective in treating anxiety, OCD and other things. Having said all that, I find tears are under the surface all the time. So much so that I embarrass myself by times. \n",

This is like paradise for us, we used to winter in a 6.5'X18' camper without our own bathroom! And while it is smaller than our northern home, we have always lived in a fairly small house, so except for missing my sewing room & not having my own washer & dryer, this is pretty nice for us. Being old for a mobile, we have the usual maintenance issues, fortunately my husband can fix most of them. Our friends have dwellings like ours, or campers or motor homes. They range in size from around 100 square feet to maybe 750. Many of us have a covered patio or enclosed porch, which is where most socializing happens. And when we're not on lockdown we have two wonderful buildings for numerous activities plus a pool. These are open now for necessary things like mail, but no gathering. Here in Deep South Texas, we can be outdoors part of almost every day, which eases the closeness. I am also much more of an extrovert, out and about chatting & doing, while my husband stays in except for his few select activities.\nBut the small area can be a challenge \u2013 especially now with travel beyond our small park so severely limited. If it gets tense I just go for a walk, whether I want to or not. The worst is the constant loud TV from 5pm to midnight with no escape, no matter what is on it. At least there is no daytime TV habit \u2013 nor much to watch on our 5 available channels.\nI know what you mean about forgetting dinner, but I have been trying to get him and his grill going more often \u2013 gets him busy planning & cooking. Also, we find it helpful to plan dinner one day that can be served at least 2 more times. Once as pure leftovers, and then as something else. For example, tonight is smoked & grilled pork tenderloin with sweet potatoes and cole slaw. Tomorrow will be same, except maybe a veg instead. Then I will thin-slice the remaining pork and make hot pork sandwiches and salad (either Wed or into the freezer for a later date.)\nAlmost time for my morning walk need to grab my coffee & get dressed.\nStay positive and safe\nSue\n",

        "content": "Thanks for links, Lisa. I guess \"doing fairly well\" is a relative thing. It's still a major struggle. \nI had my first anxiety attack at 19, and struggled through most of my 20s. At around 30 or 31, I met a psychiatrist through an anxiety self-help group. He convinced me it was a brain chemistry issue, and put me on a Prozac and Clonazapam. It kicked right in and I would say that my anxiety was under control \u2014 often not even a factor \u2014 for 35 years. I would have setbacks occasionally, but was able to work through them. I retired from full-time work in late 2018, and everything was bliss. I had a nice freelance writing business. We were all set to travel, get out of Florida in the summer. Then early last July, shortly after returning from a three-day trip to a resort in Pennsylvania for a travel writing assignment, I got hit with a massive case of itching. That quickly transitioned into tingling in my hands. I was having nights with only intermittent sleep. On advice of a neurologist, I increased my low dose of Clonazepam.\nMy anxiety spiked way up and stayed after the neuropathy took hold. Switching to LexaPro helped. But I'm still struggling. Probably worst of all, my neuropathy has worsened so that my toes and fingertips are numb, my feet often burn, usually at night, and the tinging in my hands is more like stinging. It ebbs and flows in intensity, but it's never gone. \nMy biggest fear at the moment is the potential for continuing spread of my neuropathy. I really don't have health anxiety. I'm not consciously afraid of catching the coronavirus. I know I'm doing all that I can. I am concerned about a continued stretch of isolation, although my wife and I get along great. Now and again, my mind wanders into: Am I going to be able to handle this for two, three months? Will I end up a basket case in a rubber room? Ultimately, I know that's not what happens with anxiety disorder, that the spikes always recede. \nI recommend to all folks who have anxiety disorder a book and app called \"The Dare Response,\" started and written by an Irishman named Barry McDonagh. https://dareresponse.com\nAlso, for pain, an app called Curable that takes a mind-body approach is effective. https://www.curablehealth.com\nAnd finally, as very good program by a psychologist in California named Alan Gordon. He has a free 21-day program that takes a different approach to managing or eliminating pain. https://www.tmswiki.org/forum/painrecovery/\nWhile the program has not improved my PN symptoms, it has helped me cope and given me new insights. \nI've just written a memoir. I'll stop now. Thanks for responding. I just did 90 minutes in a dentist chair w/o anxiety to speak of. We're supposed to acknowledge our victories, however small they may seem to others. So, yipeee. OK, I'm really going to stop now \ud83d\ude42 \u2014 Eric\n",

In early January when we learned of this I started to prepare, I always keep pretty stocked up as I don\u2019t like to grocery shop so I tend to buy several of the same items, so I didn\u2019t have to go out and hoard. I gave up the gym and my lymphadema massages in February and myself and my husband are on now on our 11th day of isolation.  I cancelled all my drs and blood work appointments and am hoping that a couple of months delay will not make a difference.  I am also paranoid that\u2019s why we (my husband and I) don\u2019t leave the house.  I wipe all my deliveries with Clorox wipes, We have a table in the garage that we put the mail on, when  we receive the mail I spray what is important and trash the rest, I also put the shredder in the garage so I can shred what I consider unwanted mail. We are lucky that we have neighbors to pick us up things if need be.  I am expecting that we will be in self isolation for at least another month  if not longer. My friends know me and smile because they know how I am.  Doing this has lessened the stress for me.  I must say I am not as motivated as I can be to do things but I decided to do two things a day.

Please consider using some of your down-time in isolation to contact your Congressional representatives about the issue. According to my pharmacist and PCP, it has to do with some arcane Medicare regulations about the government not \"accepting\" compensation from the pharma companies. Makes no sense to deny a benefit to a Medicare (or Medicaid) recipient that anyone else is eligible for \u2013 and government doesn't benefit from the discount, the patients benefit, especially since Medicare doesn't pay for the drugs anyway.\nAnother thing to consider \u2013 we always look at our plan choices before selecting \u2013 some Medicare Part B (injectables, inhalables & devices) and Part D (prescription) plans cover a lot more than others, often for only a small difference in Premium. For example, we pay for a plan (unfortunately not available to the general public) that covers all our meds with reasonable copays, but costs $3500/ year more than the cheaper one available to us. But just ONE of my husband's meds would cost us that much without our insurance, not to mention my meds and our other expenses.

So far, we have found a low premium is still our best choice (I think it\u2019s considered catastrophic coverage) Before My surgery and treatment for colon cancer, we applied for  medical/financial assistance, which really helped. I was going to change our plan and pay a higher premium, but this allowed us to keep our existing plan/premium. . Also, hospitals sometimes can refer patients/applicants to  companies that carry long term 2 or  more year (our hospital only does one year ) no interest loans.   I challenged and requested an exception on one if my husbands eye drips and was given a tier exception. So, sometimes that can be done.

Things are not as bad as they claim, the media is exaggerating the impact, but emphatically I am not saying that older people (such as myself), especially older people with various health issues (such as myself), need not be careful. Although I agree, this is worse than the flu, the flu causes a tremendous loss of life on it's own. And a vaccine, according to the epidemiologist I've listened to, may be over a year away. He said they can do more harm with vaccines if not properly designed and tested, then having no vaccine at all. He supports vaccines, but he said they must be careful in its design. But he stressed his findings in California, many more people have been infected than previously realized, and especially younger people may experience the virus without symptoms, or with mild symptoms. And this decreases the death rate, as they were calculating it early as known positives vs death rate, which is improper, you must calculate the total infected vs the death rate. \nThe HHS encouraged doctors to report fatalities as covid even without proof. The epidemologists I've listened to said there is a difference between deaths with covid and deaths from covid, he said the mere presence of the virus does not mean it was the one that caused the death. So the numbers are likely inflated. But be careful, I'm not suggesting this is a hoax, but I don't believe it's as bad as being constantly reported. \n",

I agree there is much we do not know about Covid-19. But here are some things we DO know which differentiate if from seasonal influenza, many of which are just now becoming clear:\nThere is no immunity, meaning everyone who comes into contact with the virus can get it, and therefore pass it on, whether they themselves feel ill or not. This is especially perilous to vulnerable populations, who often have other challenges that prevent them from keeping THEMSELVES safe \u2013 such as congregate living, homelessness, repeated exposure to caregivers who may also be in contact with people who are ill\u2026\nIt is up to 2.5 times more contagious than influenza \u2013 meaning it spreads exponentially \u2013 very obvious in populations like packing plants, where people work side-by-side, large groups of workers suddenly become ill, and spread the virus widely in the community.\nThere is emerging evidence that this virus is able to attack circulatory system, lungs, kidneys and other organs in such a way that is causes serious, possibly permanent damage, even in young and apparently healthy people.\nMy daughter works in a metropolitan emergency department where large numbers of people are being treated for Covid-19 complications, and she reports the opposite regarding death rate \u2013 they must over-justify counting a death as related to the virus in the absence of a positive test, and at the same time are not allowed to administer the test to those who have \"obvious\" Covid-19 symptoms because there is still a shortage of testing capacity.\nFinally, once there is widespread availability and use of antibody screening tests, I also believe the death rate will decline.\nBut there is NO WAY this is like seasonal flu \u2013 we have seen, at a minimum, 40,000 deaths in less than 2 months, which represents at least 250,000 deaths in one year, or 3 to 10 times as many as influenza.\nI would refer you to https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/category/covid-19/ for up-to-date information about the virus, the latest research, and what each of us can do to remain safe.\nSue\n",

Here is 1 Hour and 12 Minutes of the Doctor/Professor/Epidemiologist Explaining why the death count is likely much lower than stated, he's enjoyable to watch because he's not political. I hope you, and others, enjoy it as much as my wife and I have. \nPerspectives on the Pandemic | Dr. John Ioannidis Update: 4.17.20 | Episode 4\n\nWhile I have your attention, let me tell you things that I know. I taught Air Purifying Respirators for nearly 8 years, to 1200 people per year, in classes of 35 or so, in an Industrial Setting. I've been through the information before. N-95 \u2013 does any one even know what the N Means? It means Not Oil Resistant, versus R-95 that are Oil Resistant, and P-95, which is oil proof \u2013 There's 95%, 99%, and 99.97% (basically 100%) that refer to the ability of the respirators to filter particles 0.3 microns in diameter or larger. The virus in question is smaller than 0.125 microns? I'm at a loss to see how professionals are sufficiently protected by a respirator that is not only permitting the virus to pass through the filtering media, albeit in small numbers, but that also, by the nature of the respirator (Negative Pressure Filtering Facepiece Respirators and Elastomeric Respirators [the kind used with replaceable cartridges] both types experience leaks at the face to facepiece seal. 3M advises against the use of such respirators for dangerous pathogens for that very reason. Yet not only are the respirators not available to the public, not only are they allowing a reduced percentage of pathogens around the seal or through the filtering element anyway, but the eyes are an entry point for the virus as well. So the authorities say to wrap a scarf around your face and you're protected? This entire pandemic, from the U.S. and world perspective, is not being handled according the harm that they tell us is occurring (and I am not saying it's a hoax). I believe the media may be overstating things so that people take it seriously, and people should take it seriously, especially those in higher risk categories and those that visit such people. But conspiracy theories can involve the overstating of a situation as well as understating it. I think we're programmed to think of certain people when we say Conspiracy Theories, and yes, I've read older articles by Stanford Epidemiologists saying the situation is being over stated, but with the new study from California, they appear to be right. \nAt some point we must consider the deaths from a wrecked economy possibly exceeding the deaths from the virus. I only stated to relax when I researched and discovered statistics on other diseases, such as up to 80,000+ deaths from the flu in the U.S. on some bad years, and 600,000 World Wide. \nIf it's so contagious, and the respirators leak, and permeate, as I said, and I can offer the 3M Documentation saying that such respirators must not be used for dangerous pathogens, something just isn't right with what we're seeing.  \nYou cannot extrapolate the deaths in 2 months to a years worth of flu deaths, the flu deaths occur over 4 months top. 80,000 deaths in a flu season a few years ago is 20,000 per month averaged over 4 months, and 26,000+ per month averaged over 3 months. At this time. we simply don't know if this virus will continue through the summer, I agree if the rate would continue unabated the situation would be worrisome. Watch the video, he's advocating a slow return to normal, when it's decided that it's time. So people can be reassured, but I agree, we must all still be careful. \nThank you for the response. \n",

        "content": "By all means, take precautions, I myself am. I'm not making light of the virus, but I think there's things we need to learn and apply to other viral outbreaks, including the flu. I listened to a Swedish doctor that said they did not see the extent of covid infections in their nursing homes that we did. But one reason is they have smaller nursing homes than we do. A Stanford researcher said we must guard the vulnerable, including hospitals and nursing homes, I couldn't agree more, I don't think he believes enough is being done in that regard, and the loss of people from these areas rather proves it. I am not talking the quality of the staff, I'm specifically addressing the control of infectious pathogens. \nI worked in an Industrially Challenging place. As an Electrician (an Industrial Electrician, I paid to have my house rewired, it's not the same, though I could have struggled with it) my job was less demanding than the Mechanical Repair employees. There were devices that used electricity, we fixed that, but the things these devices connected to were installed and removed by the Mechanics. In that regard, Gas Streams were involved, things that you're not permitted to be exposed to over 20 ppm (parts per million) existed in these pipes and processes at over 500,000 ppm. Without full face respirators, breathing air and Hazmat Suits, some of these things were quickly deadly. Many would render a person unconscious with a single breath. Teams then had to wear the proper PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and go into the area to rescue the worker. Thankfully, I wasn't a Mechanic (they did all the dangerous stuff) so I never had to wear Breathing Air to do my job. \nBut other chemicals were present, and particulates. And both these were at levels that OSHA permitted the use of Air Purifying Respirators. Respirators were ubiquitous, everyone had to wear them, working an 8 hour shift is was possible to be in the Air Purifying Respirator most of the shift. So they were very important. \nThe Union offered me a position as a Safety Rep, and I accepted. I like to research, I like to read technical literature about things that interest me. So I discovered areas where improvements were possible in Respirator use in the plant. At one point, the yearly Industrial Hygiene classes were taught by a contracted employee, and the Corporation offered it to the Union, and Union people, with contacts from the Company throughout the day, began to instruct various segments of Industrial Hygiene. The Segments were provided, Power Points, and the class and content was approved by the Corporation. I was grateful to both the Union and Corporation for the opportunity. \nWe were provided training as part of our job, over the years, from the International Union, and from the Company. We had completed the Train the Trainer Outreach Training with OSHA, and attended week long Safety Seminars once yearly provided by the Company. Alas, Local Union Presidents appoint the safety reps, so after two and a half terms, one and one half with one president, and one term with another, I wasn't appointed to the safety office of an incoming Local Union President. Such is life, it was interesting and challenging but we all know that the Local President decides, it's just the way it is. \nI think Respirators will reduce the chance of getting an infection, I think the right respirator or surgical mask reduces particles given off by those that are infected, during a cough, sneeze, or just talking. They both keep a person from inadvertently touching their mouth or nose while in areas that may have infectious agents present. I agree that a scarf, or other covering can prevent particles from significantly becoming airborne, so I understand why some areas require this.\nTake care, enjoyed writing this, hope this is what you wanted as a response. \nBe well. \n",

Then I remembered times when my mother and in-laws were discharged from hospital and in no way ready to be at home, even with our help. A move, temporary or permanent to a care facility was the only choice. This is the unfortunate situation we are facing now.\nThe headlines in the paper today says \"ICU Beds are Running Short.\" The Twin Cities was mentioned on national news yesterday as a hot spot, our ICU beds, although not technically full, are at capacity in terms of available staff, and the number of cases has not fallen.  Since many cases in our hospitals here are people from the care facilities, they are sicker and require longer care than the general population. There must be a place to send people ready for discharge, but not ready for home.\nIf there had been central planning and coordination from the day Covid-19 darkened our lives, safe arrangements could have been made. Specific buildings or wings (not floors) of larger facilities could have been designated \"all Covid-19\" and healthy residents moved out, special training, extra staff and adequate equipment should have been provided. Didn't happen \u2013 hospitals and nursing homes (even today) are racing and struggling to care for the patients as best they can, with a shrinking pool of caregivers as they fall to the virus themselves or \"pull the plug\" because they are overwhelmed or frightened, and facilities are still begging for PPE from the public as orders they place are hijacked or cancelled without explanation (this is not a political statement \u2013 our governor experienced it this week and my daughter's hospital has had it happen more than once.)\nOn a positive note, our governor has ordered and is assisting in testing all residents and staff in congregate living facilities, in making transition and isolation plans and providing training. In one large care home, which had no cases, staff and residents' families were able to convince management to not admit Covid-19 positive people. At least one other has a safety plan \u2013 test prospective residents, if positive, no admit and if negative 30 days quarantine in a single room in a special unit with dedicated staff before moving to their permanent room.\nAs always with this beast \u2013 stay tuned for further information.

It has always been true that infections, whether viral or bacterial, blast through their very vulnerable populations at an alarming rate, and many people die. Now, as we have many more care options, I believe it is even worse because, on average, residents are even older and sicker when they enter care. Unfortunately, lack of staffing, money to adequately pay staff, education and effective oversight have combined with this pandemic to create a truly frightening scenario.  Even our best facilities, quite highly rated for compliance to all regs, have had outbreaks here, with many deaths. \nIt has brought to light something nobody has publicly addressed \u2013 infection control among crowded, high-risk populations.

A public service announcement would be a good start. We must protect our health care workers first and treat others according to what the experts determine.

But like any new treatment, there is a huge curve to climb \u2013 isolation, testing for efficacy, then for safety, then approval. I don't think there are any safe shortcuts, and anyone promising that should be suspect.\nAlso, as of yesterday, there was not a publicly available approved post-test for the antibodies in the US \u2013 right now most energy is focused on getting everything geared up for high volume initial testing and developing an accurate rapid test. Once there is an antibody test available, expect to see the first use to be concentrated on medical personnel and other first responders, so employers know they can get back to work without intense fear of reinfection.\nI won't throw numbers around because we don't know how accurate they are, but in a lot of the country, there are so few tests available compared to the numbers of people with symptoms and/or known exposure, that many people are being told no to a test and being sent into quarantine on the assumption they are infected. Tests are being reserved for testing where there is very high risk of infecting vulnerable populations, like in nursing homes. So we are some time away from a wide focus on antibody testing, I think.\nIn the mean time, our best defense is to take precautions \u2013 isolation, handwashing, surface sanitizing, and eating well to stay as strong as possible.\nSue\n",

Tell me what your thoughts are on how effective that can be.\nFARRUGIA: So we know that in order to really handle this crisis, we have to take many different approaches. The best antivirus still remains washing your hands, and we have to remind people of that. Then there are the antivirals themselves that attack the virus themselves. Then there are agents that are effective at blocking the molecules that the virus causes our own cells to release. And that can prevent some of the damage we're seeing in the lungs and other organs, including the kidneys. And then there are these convalescent ser- or convalescent plasma. Where you take plasma from a person who has had the virus and has recovered and has now an antibody response to it. And take that and in general, you can treat four people from one person. And doing so, you can provoke a artificial- a given response that allows them to recover more quickly. This is based on other diseases. It is now being tried for the coronavirus, for COVID-19. And Mayo Clinic and other institutions are working very hard, collaborating with industry to make sure that we can have adequate supply to test if this is going to make a difference. And I'm hopeful that it will.\"\nWatch or read the entire interview here: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-gianrico-farrugia-on-face-the-nation-march-29-2020/\n",

Rushing products to market may work for the latest fad or gadget, but not for a critical medical test. There are many, many steps in proper validation for medical tests, and they take a long time. Before release, the test results generally undergo peer review as well. All of this was bypassed under emergency orders, and tests were allowed to be released with the assurance of validity by the developer alone. \nIn any other time, the current Covid-19 antibody tests would not see the light of day, much less be promoted, until tested by an independent laboratory and having the results peer-reviewed. Shortcuts can have serious, even deadly consequences. If a vulnerable person were to get a \"false positive\" result and stop taking precautions, then get Covid-19 \u2026 I don't even want to think about it.\nWe also need a few more answers about what being positive for antibodies really means. Can one be reinfected, or do the antibodies confer immunity? If immune, for how long? If you can get reinfected, would it be more or less severe? And on and on\u2026 Again, these answers are beginning to emerge as scientists do their research, both for a vaccine and studying immunity. So far, what is coming out looks positive \u2013 that is, in primates and mice, antibodies seem to prevent reinfection by the virus, but until we know for sure, the test, at least for those of us at high risk, is immaterial.\nAs always, stay tuned for further developments\nSue  \n",

        "content": "Hi @aliali, How nice it is to be making a new cyber friend from Saudi Arabia. The Mayo Connect forums have introduced me to an amazing number of courageous members whom I could have never become acquainted with otherwise.  Members from Canada, Nova Scotia, Scotland, Australia, England,and  Italy are but a few who are enriching my U.S. life through their posts and glimpses of how our more distant neighbors are managing virus conditions during this worldwide pandemic.\nLike you, I am missing \"before virus\"  face-to-face contact and previously shared activities with friends and family.  While some seem to be using more stay- at-home time to be cleaning out closets, starting new volunteer projects of making masks, delivering food to others and tackling large productive projects, exploring new hobbies and pastimes, I seem to wander through each day under some cloud of non-physically induced blanket of fatigue. Basic home, yard, health, diet and sleep maintenance seems to be the most I can accomplish these days.  You know life has radically changed when you have a dream of fresh radishes, which were never a favorite veggie, and the first item on each daily \"to do list\" is planning the evening meal.  Smiles \nWhat seems to help me most is to force myself \"to keep moving\" throughout the day even if that just means less time sitting in front of tv or computer screens. Like you I enjoy exercising in groups but I'm finding as @suz55, @colleenyoung, and @johnbishop mentioned, a bit of daily sunshine and regular solitary walks or home exercise does wonders for improving my mood.  \nLike suz55, just the thought of voluntarily taking a cold shower gives me goose bumps!  However, even though it might \"shock\" me into more constructive action, I'll leave that to other braver souls to explore. Just call me a royal wimp; I shiver at just the thought of winter.  \nThe numerous threads provided within the Covid-19 forum have offered a wonderful way to stay cyber connected with others who share the same interests and hobbies. The walking, visual escapes, gardening, humor and anxiety threads have added both a positive diversion and also needed motivation for me to share and participate with others.     \n",

If I sleep in until 8 or 9 am now, I think I\u2019ve lost the better part of my day. Vbg   Not sure what the temp was on the early morning walk but if we are experiencing triple digit heat on May 1st, I can only dread what a scorcher the summer will be.  \nWe\u2019ve been on twice/week outdoor sprinkler restrictions for several years.  Drought worthy plants are the name of the game here and the challenge will be to keep those alive with hand watering.\n@lioness, I\u2019ve plucked many a tender dandelion leaf to sample but they always tasted so bitter.  Sounds like your hubby may have saut\u00e9ed them like I\nI do, using olive oil and a splash of apple vinegar with spinach, kale or swiss chard for a wilted salad or omelet.  Do you remember how he prepared them?  I\u2019ve heard of dandelion wine but never got to sample any.  Now, an apricot cordial or glass of blackberry wine is another matter entirely!  Smiles   And hats off to you for crediting your walks to the loss of 5 pounds.  Since I have the opposite challenge, would you consider a cyber share with me?  I mean if you don\u2019t have someone else in mind for them???\n@zep and@robbie1956, Thanks for reading between the lines on my earlier post.  I am mortified that my impulsive share may have had unintended consequences.  Feisty: Remember you have duct tape, use it!!!!\nWe can only hope but I fear that \u201cyour saint and my \u2018abutt\u201d are much more driven by the urgency of economic survival than that of saved lives through using a more considered and measured approach to reopening.\n@jimhd I\u2019m laughing at your take on weeds.  The old adage of : \u201cone person\u2019s trash is another\u2019s treasure \u201c certainly applies here. Vbg  \nI sow Bachelor Buttons, (cornflowers) each year to encourage their multi-hued bursts of early color.   And when my feverfew eventually died out, I was thrilled to bring back seeds from my daughter\u2019s new home to restart them in a few of my beds. \nYou have to remember that this is the same gal who liberally spends retirement dollars on liberal annual purchases of soil amendments to soften concrete hard clay for some patches of beauty.   I will confess that the few spindly twigs of  evening primroses given me a few years have now created hours of plucking because of their unexpected spread.   Your choke cherry sounds like the sprawl of planted  honeysuckle that nearly took over my yard before spending big dollars to get it eradicated.  We live and learn, yes?  Smiles\n@gingerw, like you I spend far too much time going after plum and pecan tree sprouts that are the very devil to uproot.  \n@sueinmn, I like your analogy of the virus particle as a \u201cspeck of dust not a cockroach\u201d.  We in west Tx have a liberal share of those dratted cockroach varmits as well!\nI'm off for another \"bonus\" morning walk before doing some more Johnson grass weed pulling in a back flower bed.  \n",

For those familiar with artemesia and yarrow, you\u2019ll understand the labor involved each spring in severely trimming back the sprawl that starts to cover backyard paths.  Yesterday I left the alley gate open while carting tons of the cut backs to the dumpster.  While sitting on my rump and cutting away, two young dogs entered my yard and began exploring.  When they saw me, they were curious about the human on the ground but were tooskittish to approach close enough for petting.  I closed them in and walked to alley hoping to find their human in search of them.  Instead, saw the wooden fence break which might have caused their escape.  About to walk around the block to knock on neighbor\u2019s door, he came out and I showed him the break and told him I the puppies in my yard for safe keeping.\nAs we became acquainted, I asked how he and his family were doing being new to our community and neighborhood during this time of virus spread.  I offered to exchange names and numbers in case something like this should happen again.  We did exchange info and he thanked me and also offered to pick up anything I might need because he made a daily trip to visit his elderly mom.  Now how nice was that????\nWhile my arms/hands ache today from all the physical work, my heart is so happy by his kind offer.   Even during these stressful, restrictive times, gardening provides so many and sometimes unexpected benefits.  Smiles to all.\nHi, @aliali, Glad that something I wrote might have helped.  We are all in this together!  Had to laugh at your consideration of taking up boxing.  While there have been a few times during this virus that I would have liked to \u201cpunch\u201d something in frustration, I hadn\u2019t thought of boxing as a mood elevator or stress reducer.\nMy hubby used one of those huge hammers..like you see in carnivals where they try to make the ball go up?,  and would use it to bang on a large tree stump in our bkyd whenever he got really frustrated.  My favorite was to drive to a pond and throw rocks!  Not driving now, so maybe boxing is the answer?  Very big smile.  Good to hear from you.  Are you staying safe and well?\n@lilypaws, I\u2019ve been following your posts and wishing you the best with your upcoming surgery.  Thank you for the kind words, Jeanie.  Until you are able to resume walks following your surgery, I\u2019ll send you cyber wishes for a happy recovery while on mine?  \nHi, @tmvickery, I\u2019m meeting you here for the first time.  Like you, I am usually pretty sociable and outgoing.  However because of the virus spread, I\u2019ve become accustomed to not driving and staying home.  My lung issues will keep me home longer than many because people in my area are not observing distancing or masking guidelines.\nI also rely heavily on the internet to keep me informed and on nightly Netflix and computer games and reading to keep me entertained.\nBeing cyber connected with others through Mayo Connect groups has been an excellent boon for me.  My walks and gardening keep me moving.  Otherwise, I can find it all too easy to stretch out on the sofa for some mindless tv and unplanned naps.  Are you finding other interests now that you are not enjoying being out in public as much?  \n",

While there have been a few times during this virus that I would have liked to \u201cpunch\u201d something in frustration, I hadn\u2019t thought of boxing as a mood elevator or stress reducer.\nMy hubby used one of those huge hammers..like you see in carnivals where they try to make the ball go up?,  and would use it to bang on a large tree stump in our bkyd whenever he got really frustrated.  My favorite was to drive to a pond and throw rocks!  Not driving now, so maybe boxing is the answer?  Very big smile.\nGood to hear from you.  Are you staying safe and well?\u201d\n",

My daughters, Mom & Auntie who helps care for them, have been fabulous keeping is connected with pictures, videos, calls & Zoom. The 16 mo old now grabs Auntie's phone and starts poking buttons when he wants her to call so he can wave to us! Sometimes I just drive to their house and play with the 4 yo at a safe distance through the front door \u2013 jumping, counting, etc, but it's not the same as hugs from all of them.\nI also designed, sewed & am finishing a quilt for the almost 4 yo for his big-boy bed. That has entertained me for the better part of a week, and I need to finish by the end of the month for his birthday. Then I will finish a \"Grandma Bear\" for the little guy, made from his preemie sleeper that he wore home from the hospital \u2013 his big brother reminded me that \"he needs one like mine.\" I hope my arthritic thumb & neck hold out to get these done!\nI feel so sorry for you and your friend. I have a good friend who is struggling to care for her husband with dementia, and try to connect with her every day or so. Is there anything you can do remotely for your friend?\nSue\n",

Where we are, the thrift stores will take unsorted as long as not broken. Mine go to the local transitional living organization \u2013 people moving from homelessness to transitional housing to independent housing \u2013 they love educational toys, puzzles, books and the old stand-bys like Legos and Fisher-Price, any kind of cars and trucks, etc. Or don't do the sorting in the basement \u2013 just bring the boxes up to a spare room, porch or the garage and go through them where it is more pleasant. \nIn evenings I sit nearby and do things on my computer or phone while my husband watches TV as I mostly don't watch anyway.  Today I will finish my grandson's new quilt, so for the next couple evenings I will be finishing the binding \u2013 lots of hand sewing.

        "content": "@ozma Hello and welcome to Mayo Connect. We are a group of people sharing our journeys through a wide variety of health conditions, but we are not doctors and cannot offer medical advice. What we share is how we live and adapt. Along the way we try to share science based information and knowledge.\nThat said, most current advice says close contact with immediate members of your household is generally okay unless you (or one of them) is in a risk category, whether due to age or health conditions. Or unless someone has symptoms of illness (but remember some people seem to have the virus without showing symptoms) or has been closely exposed to someone who has the virus (like caring for an ill person, working for hours close to someone infected.)\nSo, sleeping with a partner who is also self-isolating (and taking proper precautions) would probably be okay. If you are not high risk, sleeping with someone who works but is not in a frontline job and takes precautions \u2013 probably okay. Sleeping with a partner who works in a frontline job, exposed repeatedly, even if careful \u2013 maybe \u2013 if you are not high risk. \nSame answer with others in the household \u2013 you need to know they are using good judgment and taking proper precautions, otherwise they should minimize contact within the home \u2013 either stay in their rooms or a separate part of the house. And use a separate bathroom or sanitize between users, same with the kitchen. Some people seem to feel if it is okay to go to work, it is okay to socialize with friends during breaks or before or after work \u2013 I would class them as high risk and minimize contact if I was in a risk category. \nI hope this helps. I will say, my daughters are nurses, many of their friends are also nurses or other first responders, they have mostly decided to remain in contact WITH their families, except those directly working in ER and ICU. But both of them have always had the policy of removing their work scrubs and washing up thoroughly immediately after work \u2013 long before Covid-19 came on the scene.\nSue\n",
