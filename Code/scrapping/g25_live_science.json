        "content": "hey all, due to an abundance of posts touting natural remedies, diy cures, and generally dangerous misinformation about the coronavirus, the community team thought it would be a good idea to collect all of these into a single spot. this thread is intended to debunk covid-19 myths, hoaxes, untested suppositions, and any other claims that are \"too good to be true.\" first things first, there is currently no medically approved cure or vaccine for coronavirus, period. there are many groups and institutions working to find it, but these things take time. when people are afraid, they are more likely to try things that are risky or untested, so we will not allow posts that claim to be a cure to remain in our forums. in this thread we'd like to hear any suspicious information that you've heard here, or elsewhere. this is not to continue the spread of questionable info, but so we can engage with the community to provide verifiable data to the contrary of these claims. we encourage all of our livescience forum experts to contribute their knowledge to this thread. please make sure to cite from a secondary or primary source when debunking a hoax. with a herd mentality and the exchange of knowledge we can defeat the grifters out there trying to profit from this public health crisis. some misinformation that we've seen and removed includes: drinking bleach ingesting colloidal silver specially grown food products general \"wonder drugs\" coronavirus was caused by, or is linked to, 5g phone networks statements that are not proven with this strain of virus: coronavirus will die off when the weather gets warmer the best way to prevent the transmission of covid-19 is to practice social distancing (keeping 6 feet/2 meters from one another or at the very least, 3 feet/1 meter from the nearest person), and to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly (20 seconds at least). while the forum rules are posted to every subforum, it's good to call special attention to this specific rule here: live science forums host discussions based on established scientific principles, and as such, posts that attempt to ignore the preponderance of evidence, disavow scientific fact, or engage in logical fallacies to arrive at unfounded conclusions will be removed.",

(analogy time) while a cure is being developed (antibodies for the tcells to seek out) they contain it with a blood-brain barrier and trying to cough it away from the lungs. the mobilize other systems to fully contain and kill the invader, like making white blood cells. don't draw crazy conclusions please, you body is doing the best it can.",

i told him: tim said he couldn\u2019t taste or smell any thing either... i looked at him and i said oh no! maybe it\u2019s coronavirus!? i went and talked to my son asking him, what other symptoms he had. he told me that he haven\u2019t been feeling that good all weekend, and just been tired. which i did notice because he was going to sleep earlier than usual, being that he spends most of the nights very late on his ps4 gaming. that weekend he was asleep by the time i got home. my husband was sick friday but went to work, and felt very out of it all weekend, and on that monday i was feeling out of it, but went to work and i felt very tired, and i remember not having any desire to eat, on my break, which is very unusual. i also remember having very bad stomach pains, and was so tired that i was just counting the minutes to go home and felt like laying down the whole night. i yawned and was very out of it, by the end of my 8 hour shift... when i got home finally is when we all realized that this could be the virus, which we all tried so hard to protect ourselves against, with constantly washing and sanitizing, i had disinfected every thing the best i could, used alcohol swabs everywhere i went, wiped my steering wheel shifters, keys, phone door handles light switches and everything we brought in from the store, or from the outside. we social disgraced like we possibly ever could. we went nowhere! except work, and the market if needed only! i wouldn\u2019t allow guests over, everything was on pause, and we followed all public officials guidance. but, the week i leave the men to fen for themselves... sh*t hit the fan, and it went everywhere! my son and husband went to pick up pizza, from the local pizza place, while i was at work. my son always took his mask everywhere, and wore it while in public, when we went to the market, gas station, etc. but that night he ran in to grab the pizza, and he forgot to bring his mask, but he figured, ah, no biggie, the counter is like 4 feet from the entrance and it will be quick. well, mind you, nobody in that pizza place wears masks, still don\u2019t from the last i checked, and that\u2019s the only place we can think of where this virus must of been contracted from. this was mid week of that friday, my son first became aware of any symptom. by the time we figured it out i had already been to work a few nights, but that monday i noticed a difference in my physical abilities. tuesday i called work and explained what was going on, and that thursday i got tested. my husband also called out, which he called out that monday, and was in bed for the next two and a half weeks. he experienced a very sharp pain on the top of his skull, in the top, slightly to the left of his head, he was in agonizing pain for at least 10 days straight and any pain reliever he took, did no justice. he hardly ate, he felt pretty warm to hot, for a good 5-7 days, which he may have experienced a fever, but with a thermometer, i couldn\u2019t say for sure. i personally don\u2019t know if i ever had a temperature, however we are supposed to check our temps before every shift, nobody ever really does, but we are required to wear masks, no exceptions! this in fact is my true analysis, and conclusion, that masks 100% work, to slow or stop the spread. had i or my coworkers not been wearing them, they all would of contracted this virus. not one of them did!!! we worked 8 hours very close in proximity and i was experiencing full on symptoms that last night i worked. moreover, had my son wore a mask upon going into that pizza place for only a couple minutes, he would of never been exposed! he hadn\u2019t gone anywhere else that week, but there, or without coverings, otherwise. but from that moment forward we were all very out of it and very tired, far more than i could ever explain. my husband didn\u2019t go get tested that day i went because he could barely lift his head, to get out of bed. my son wanted to go get tested, but their policy only aloud ages 18 and over to be tested, which in my opinion makes it clear, why the numbers of 17 and younger, infected people were very low. they only tested younger people if they went in to the er with similar symptoms, or if they were referred by their primary physician. but anyway, the next several weeks were sluggish, house started piling up, lawn wasn\u2019t getting watered, etc... it took 8 days to get my positive for covid-19 results and it was official. after the long drawn out next couple weeks passed, my symptoms turned into a whole different issue, while my husband was feeling better, i started to get strange pressure in my chest. it would feel very heavy and i felt like it would stop me in my tracks. or keep me numb for around 10-15 minutes at a time. if i sat up, lay down, turn over, or laid on my side, either side, it would just feel like extreme pressure in my chest. this happened a few times a day. i honestly thought i was probably going to die. that went from chest tightness, to just feeling like someone was squeezing my heart. to this day, i have experienced this almost daily. although it\u2019s a little more milder than it was before, i still fell it. my son also told me he gets the same thing in his chest, but he describes it as not as intense as myself. recently my daughter, who lives near by, who\u2019s 20, has told me that she\u2019s been experiencing those same symptoms, and just a few days ago, my son while visiting said her two roommates also were saying they are getting unusual chest symptoms. i told my daughter they should go get the anti-bodies test, because they probably got the virus and don\u2019t know. because during that time we were infected, in fact that monday we realized what it might be, i gave her a ride to meet her grandparents because they were going to vegas for the night, and she went with them. neither of us wore masks while riding in my car, and i am 100% certain i was infected that day, which was also the last night i went to work. we finally went back the 3rd week of august, after we took an anti-bodies test, which also confirmed my husbands positive covid infection, which his work wanted him to present documentation for, amid his 5-6 weeks out. but the experience was a little surreal. quick note: not one of us experienced a cough, shortness of breath, and from self observation, only my husband experienced a fever... and finally; we did everything possible to avoid getting this virus, and until these heart symptoms finally go away completely, in hopes of being out of the woods, from possibly sealing my fate, i\u2019m sort of relieved otherwise, in having contracted this virus. i feel less stressed, in going out there, and becoming infected, and not knowing what to expect, because everyone\u2019s different and will have different symptoms, experiences, and, or end results. you could die, and that\u2019s the scary part. you can pass it on to others who can die, or who knows it could leave lasting health issues, that you never had prior to. i\u2019m still planning on going to get a full check up, but i haven\u2019t yet. further complications, are yet, to be determined. just an insight of what you may expect, if you become infected. thank you for reading.",

it does not let the mild ones staying at home self-isolating. it requests all identified patients to be hospitalized and treated. there is no such thing as uk's \"herd immunity\". every life is important, every identifiable source of virus needs to be checked and the person quarantined and treated. 3. chinese hospitals are much better equipped with masks, inhaling machines, oxygen machines, etc. and the ratio of doctors to patients is much higher than that in italy, the uk, the us. you cannot argue but sigh about this as china is benefiting from its \"factory of the world\" status and working to its full capacity to manufacture enough equipment to support the war on virus. 4. there is one secret weapon that the western medicals and the society do not accept or turn its blind eyes to it. the vast resources and knowledge base of the chinese herbal treatment. most of the medicines are non-invasive and highly effective than what the western people could imagine. as there is no cure to the virus, the quick reaction of the chinese doctors enabled them to quickly identify the best way to treat the patients using chinese herbal medicines. all patients are given herbal medicines when the illness started to show syndromes. these medicines are most effective when the illness are at the beginning stage or incubation period. the medicines do not kill the virus but they build up the body\u2019s own ability to combat the virus attack. the effectiveness of these medicines are empirically tested and the results are robust and highly reliable and this should thank to the large number of sample size in china. many types of herbal medicines are available. but one or two are proved particularly effective and are short of stock in the chinese market. 5. and finally, the chinese doctors are much more efficient, empirical and factual in their thinking and problems solving (to be honest, this is quite true at the societal level). china is becoming the biggest economy in the world in the last 20 years time out of nothing is not without a good reason if you are curious enough and want to find out. this is why corona-virus was first identified by chinese doctors in december 2019 (please do not give the nursery kids' logic that first identified = originated) even though it is highly likely that the virus had been with us long before that time. many of us (including myself) had very similar syndromes before the christmas, but we did not know or were not tested. no one even thought this could be a new virus in the uk or us or even they did no one reported. for this, we have to salute to the chinese who had already suspected and investigated in november and december 2019 before the 1st reported social media release. it took a month to identify and notified the whole country and managed to calm the people in wuhan and the whole china not panicking not mass migrating during china\u2019s business time. somehow the virus was first identified by the chinese, somehow the death rate is extremely low in china, somehow the new cases disappeared in china, somehow the recover rate is extremely high, somehow china was so peaceful and there was no panic shopping or similar incidence, ........ the underlying reasons are what the world needs to find out. as scientists, we or you are trained to find the reasons and see the patterns, and speak the truth. if you cannot see or speak the truth, how on earth you are expecting the public to be resistant to the misleading information so prevalent in the media now. all in all, coronavirus is not the deadly disease. the biased and twisted mind the mind that is reactionary to change to truth to self-reflection. it is like the bubonic plague has impact and helped the emergence of the renaissance in europe\uff0cwill this pandemic tell you the west, humble yourself, its time to self-reflect, cleanse out the prejudice in your mind that is blinding you, but have a major shift in your thought and worldview, with a sound mind, a spirit of truth, the courage of speaking the truth, the chinese is surely having the key to stay at the forefront of the war on virus, at the top of the world economically and politically and having all the resources and the blessing of a new renaissance . click to expand... look, you've posted this in 10 threads. stick to one, please, because having to scroll through the same message 10 times to read the forum is annoying. you already made your own thread about this, please don't crosspost to all the other ones too.",

        "content": "a competitive disease propagation model as an alternative to vaccination for the protection of humanity from covid-19.\u200bdraft 2 june 2020, 2000 gmt form rules prevent me from showing my gmail address. abstract\u200bthis unfinished paper is to start a discussion on an alternative model for protecting humanity from covid-19. by itself covid-19 poses enormous moral and ethical challenges. the model presented in this paper poses its own additional moral and ethical challenges, some of which will be addressed herein. one of the most critical challenges of all is the time required until the world\u2019s population is sufficiently protected from covid-19. the time required impacts lives and suffering not only from the disease itself but also from the social and economic consequences of our current efforts to protect the world\u2019s population. the economic consequences are not merely an abstract construct, but impact lives and suffering by the loss of the ability to meet basic human needs for food, shelter and education. most covid-19 research focuses on the production of antivirals and vaccinations. an alternative approach is to infect the population with a different disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, 229e, nl63, oc43 or hku1. this could allow people to produce the helper t cells that would fight covid-19, creating immunity on a faster timeline than vaccination production and distribution. the covid-19 challenges far exceed the abilities of any one group or person. as a systems engineer, computer scientist and applied mathematician this is a request for collaboration from people and teams with the expertise and resources to address these unique challenges. a comparison of competitive disease propagation and vaccination models\u200binoculating a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population with a vaccine to directly and indirectly, through herd immunity, protect humanity against covid-19 is the gold standard but is not the only approach. one can imagine multiple ways to inoculate humanity for protection from covid-19. another approach would be to infect a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population with a minor disease that as a side effect provided some immunity to covid-19. vaccination with its individual delivery to each person provides greater control over the inoculation process and consequently lower risks. but this control comes at the cost of producing and distributing individual vaccines. vaccination has at best a linear time, o( n ), production rate limitation to inoculate humanity. infecting the world\u2019s population with a disease gives up the individual control over the process with consequently higher risks. in exchange, it can at best achieve exponential spreading through the population and thus a log time, o(log( n )) complexity. a vaccination model at a high level vaccination against covid-19 consists of discovering or developing a vaccine, testing in animal models, testing in humans, clinical trials, developing a production process, constructing factories and supply chains to produce the vaccine, and developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems to inoculate a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population to protect humanity against covid-19. a competitive disease propagation model at a high level competitive disease propagation against covid-19 consists of discovering or developing a disease, testing in animal models, testing in humans, clinical trials, developing an infection process, and developing world-wide education and infection networks to inoculate a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population to protect humanity against covid-19. a comparison of the models comparing these two models shows many similar steps, with the similar steps taking comparable amounts of time. the key differences are that the vaccination model requires constructing factories and supply chains, and developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems, while the competitive disease propagation model requires developing world-wide education and infection networks. these key differences affect how the two models scale to inoculate a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population to protect humanity against covid-19. for the vaccination model, the complexity of producing inoculations scales linearly, o( n ), for the number of inoculations required. the complexity of the transportation and distribution system is o(nlog( n )) or higher. for the competitive disease propagation model, the complexity is o(log( n )) for the number of inoculations required. to put numbers to this, conservatively assume that 6 billion people or 75% of the world\u2019s nearly 8 billion population, need inoculations for adequate protection. a total combined global factory production capacity of 1 million doses per day requires 6000 days or nearly 16.5 years to produce the inoculations. a competitive disease with a duration of one week and an r0 of 10 would require 10 weeks to produce the inoculations. while these numbers are arbitrarily chosen, they illustrate the way linear vaccine production and exponential disease spreading could possibly scale. to see this from another point of view, consider the number of inoculations produced per week for the two models.

an optimistic scenario is a vaccine produced in the tens of millions in 2021, as quoted by ars technica. in addition to the time required for protection, these models also differ vastly in the type of resources required from the world\u2019s health-care systems. a competitive disease propagation model literally replaces the bioreactors and purifiers from the vaccine factories with people. it replaces the world-wide transportation and distribution systems with people. the impact of this difference in countries with weaker health-care systems is enormous. a competitive disease propagation model works with the resources we have. what characteristics would a competitive disease require?\u200ba competitive disease would need to meet a few goldilocks requirements. it must have sufficiently mild symptoms to minimize direct harm to people. it must be sufficiently contagious to spread rapidly through the world\u2019s population. it must then convey sufficient protection against covid-19 to make covid-19 no longer an overbearing threat to humanity. shane crotty and alessandro sette, immunologists at the la jolla institute for immunology, as well andreas thiel\u2019s team at the charit\u00e9 university hospital in berlin both have identified the presence of helper t cells that recognize and target the sars-cov-2 spike protein. the la jolla team has detected a similar presence in approximately 50% of blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, while the berlin team found 34% of analyzed blood samples from uninfected people also contained these helper t cells. the la jolla researchers speculate these helper t cells were triggered by past infection with one of the other four coronaviruses that cause colds. one or more these four common cold coronaviruses could be candidates for a competitive disease. the infectiousness of a pathogen can vary greatly with the behavior of a host. just as social distancing and isolation can reduce the infectiousness of covid-19, a cooperative effort between infected and uninfected people could boost r0 enormously. for a common cold type disease with respiratory droplet transmission, an r0 of 10 or even 100 is not out of the question. how do we spread the disease? there are a range of possibilities. one method might be using throat swabs from an infected to an uninfected person. another method might be for an infected person to intentionally cough on another, perhaps coughing into an open mouth or while the other person is inhaling. what could possibly go wrong?\u200bat the scale discussed herein, the question is how could anything not go wrong? the following is a short list of things that could go wrong and some possible mitigations. expanding this list and mitigating these problems is a crucial part of making a competitive disease model ethically, morally and practically possible. the spread of the competitive disease could be contaminated with covid-19. mitigating this risk will require testing, monitoring and tracking. this is a massive quality control issue that must be carefully addressed. the spread of the competitive disease could be contaminated with other diseases. as above, this is a massive quality control issue. one approach would be to isolate the desired disease and seed populations around the world. from there the disease can be spread from human to human. the smaller the infection hot spots are, the fewer diseases we inadvertently carry along. the competitive disease could mutate into a more dangerous strain. we are fortunate that coronaviruses mutate at a lower rate than other human pathogens, such as influenza. maximizing r0 and minimizing the size infection hot spots would both reduce the number of and risk from mutations. the idea is to keep the family tree of the disease as wide and as flat as possible. mutations are most significant on long paths from the root to the leaves of the tree. perhaps we should call this \u201cflattening the tree\u201d? seeding populations with the competitive disease allows a tradeoff between the performance and risks of the two models. at one extreme, large hot spots provide the pure competitive disease model, with its higher risks and higher speed. at the other extreme, small hot spots provide the lower risks and lower speed of the vaccination model. what comes next?\u200bhow do we start? using an existing disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, endemic to the population, with mild symptoms simplifies some of the moral and ethical challenges. we are not releasing an unknown pathogen. we are, however, intentionally increasing the probability of people\u2019s exposure. weighing the pros and cons of such a proposal should consider that spreading an existing disease is a lesser risk to the population than letting covid -19 continue along its course until a vaccine can be produced and distributed in sufficient quantities. where do we go? we need to confirm the assumed safety and efficacy of such an approach with one of the common human coronaviruses. we need to quantify the logistics requirements. there are vulnerable groups that must be protected, just as there are with covid-19. but the potential costs and savings in human lives requires attention. a discussion between people and teams who have the potential resources and interest in this model should begin. please consider this proposal and share your comments on the challenges and opportunities presented by a competitive disease model for protecting humanity from covid-19. references\u200bscientists vs politicians: the

        "content": "karl moerder said: a competitive disease propagation model as an alternative to vaccination for the protection of humanity from covid-19.\u200bdraft 2 june 2020, 2000 gmt form rules prevent me from showing my gmail address. abstract\u200bthis unfinished paper is to start a discussion on an alternative model for protecting humanity from covid-19. by itself covid-19 poses enormous moral and ethical challenges. the model presented in this paper poses its own additional moral and ethical challenges, some of which will be addressed herein. one of the most critical challenges of all is the time required until the world\u2019s population is sufficiently protected from covid-19. the time required impacts lives and suffering not only from the disease itself but also from the social and economic consequences of our current efforts to protect the world\u2019s population. the economic consequences are not merely an abstract construct, but impact lives and suffering by the loss of the ability to meet basic human needs for food, shelter and education. most covid-19 research focuses on the production of antivirals and vaccinations. an alternative approach is to infect the population with a different disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, 229e, nl63, oc43 or hku1. this could allow people to produce the helper t cells that would fight covid-19, creating immunity on a faster timeline than vaccination production and distribution. the covid-19 challenges far exceed the abilities of any one group or person. as a systems engineer, computer scientist and applied mathematician this is a request for collaboration from people and teams with the expertise and resources to address these unique challenges. a comparison of competitive disease propagation and vaccination models\u200binoculating a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population with a vaccine to directly and indirectly, through herd immunity, protect humanity against covid-19 is the gold standard but is not the only approach. one can imagine multiple ways to inoculate humanity for protection from covid-19. another approach would be to infect a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population with a minor disease that as a side effect provided some immunity to covid-19. vaccination with its individual delivery to each person provides greater control over the inoculation process and consequently lower risks. but this control comes at the cost of producing and distributing individual vaccines. vaccination has at best a linear time, o( n ), production rate limitation to inoculate humanity. infecting the world\u2019s population with a disease gives up the individual control over the process with consequently higher risks. in exchange, it can at best achieve exponential spreading through the population and thus a log time, o(log( n )) complexity. a vaccination model at a high level vaccination against covid-19 consists of discovering or developing a vaccine, testing in animal models, testing in humans, clinical trials, developing a production process, constructing factories and supply chains to produce the vaccine, and developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems to inoculate a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population to protect humanity against covid-19. a competitive disease propagation model at a high level competitive disease propagation against covid-19 consists of discovering or developing a disease, testing in animal models, testing in humans, clinical trials, developing an infection process, and developing world-wide education and infection networks to inoculate a sufficient portion of the world\u2019s population to protect humanity against covid-19. a comparison of the models comparing these two models shows many similar steps, with the similar steps taking comparable amounts of time. the key differences are that the vaccination model requires constructing factories and supply chains, and developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems, while the competitive disease propagation model requires developing world-wide education and infection networks. these

        "content": "how to prevent development of severe covid-19 disease evidence suggests that targeting innate lymphoid cells (ilcs) may be beneficial in the design of therapeutics for covid-19 generated autoimmune disorders. as ilcs and t cells have many redundant functions, targeting and neutralizing their effector cytokines might be a better option. alternatively, targeting their upstream activating mediators (il-23, il-1b, or il-6), or their survival factors (il-7) could be used as an approach to treat inflammatory diseases. the epithelium comprises a physical barrier, which together with the mucus layer and production of anti-microbial peptides provides a containment barrier, which confines microbes in the lumen. the innate lymphoid cells residing in the immune compartment of the lamina propria, which is a thin layer of connective tissue that forms part of the moist linings known as mucous membranes or mucosa, which line various tubes in the body, such as the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital tract, are key early warning sentinels detecting invading pathogens through conserved pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors. pathogen detecting populations, include cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including macrophages and dendritic cells (dcs), which engulf and process microbial antigens and present the antigens to adaptive immune cells, thus providing initial signals to adaptive immune system lymphocytes to engage potent antigen-specific t and b cell responses. innate lymphoid cells (ilcs) are distributed throughout the human body in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but are especially enriched at the mucosal barrier surfaces, where they directly interact with a number of different cell types; hematopoietic or other . ilcs have lymphoid-like morphology, but lack any antigen-specific receptors. arising from a common lymphoid progenitor and similarly to t cells, they can be further subdivided into phenotypically and functionally distinct populations that produce different combinations of effector cytokines to mediate their functions. their development depends on different transcription factors, which are also used to help divide ilcs into 5 main groups; group 1 ilcs that includes natural killer cells, as well as the non-cytotoxic ilc1s, group 2 ilcs or ilc2s, group 3 ilcs including ilc3s, group 4 containing lymphoid tissue inducer (lti) cells and, group 5 are regulatory ilcs or ilcregs. the production of interleukin-5 (il-5) by ilc2s in the lung leads to eosinophil recruitment, and other cell populations interact and shape the presence of lung ilc2s in airway inflammation. in addition, they also promote proliferation of b cells. it seems, that the increase in ilc2s present correlates with the severity of inflammation in the lungs, intestines, kidneys and other organs of patients suffering from severe covid-19, and evidence confirms some \u2018immunogen- experienced\u2019 ilc2s persist after the resolution of the initial inflammation, portraying similarities to memory t cells. so, people who have been previously exposed to other coronaviruses may carry some some \"immunogen-experienced\" ilc2s in the in the immune compartment of their lamina propria, that can provide at least partial protection against sars-cov-2. it has been shown in mice that natural killer cells (nk cells) and ilc1s inhibit ilc2 expansion due to the production of interferon- gamma, and therefore they (nk cells and non- cytotoxic group 1 innate lymphocyte cells) may help prevent the development of severe covid-19 disease. i intend to support my thesis, that the primary obligatory weapon against sars-cov-2 is our highly complex and ancient, innate immune system, and not the simple, modern adaptive immune system. universe is a zero dimensional infinity.",

(5) unlike china, russian federation, vietnam, nz, lao people's democratic republic, australian northern territory, mongolia, belarus, taiwan, tibet, papua new guinea, madagascar, srilanka, and many other regions listed by me previously, there was a dearth of people with denisovan genetic engrossment in the population of usa. which if present around 30% in a population give the population a pseudo herd immunity. i repeat, that this engrossment boosts the innate immunity, through nk cell secretions of interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha, thus quarantining the cells long enough not only giving time for adaptive immunity to develop but tnf-alpha is directly sars-cov-2 cidal. it is therefore my prediction, that non of the vaccines currently being developed will help enough, until some factors for boosting the nk cell secretions directly or through cytokine stimulus produced from tissue resident macrophages is/are co-linked with the vaccine. it is also possible, that just boosting the innate immune system alone can save lives as it is doing in the earliest austronesian aboriginals.",

        "content": "the hitchhiker\u2019s guide to immunity\u200b just for the record this has nothing to do with hitchhiking but i thought it would get your attention. in discussing covid-19 exposure, treatments and vaccines, people refer to establishing immunity against sars-cov-2, without clarifying how they are using the term immunity. what this virus does to the body with various symptoms and how patients are treated and recover eventually leads to some type of immunity. immunity may be temporary and last for days, weeks, months or years such as the flu. or immunity may last a lifetime such as with measles. as an aside, measles has the ability to wipe away 20-50% immunity to previous diseases leaving a person vulnerable to previous diseases for which they once had immunity. so how immune am i? when someone has immunity to covid-19 this means different things to different people. when the who said having covid-19 doesn\u2019t mean you could never get it again the press jumped on that. what people hear, what they read, who they talk to and what research is being pushed through the media have been influencing people\u2019s perception of immunity. there are degrees of immunity. if you get infected with the same virus again it could be just as bad as the first time, you could get infected but have a milder case, it could be so mild you don\u2019t even know you have it but you are still contagious and are spreading it to others, or you may never get infected again. there are no guarantees as everyone\u2019s body reacts differently and this virus attacks differently. many people believe if they get infected again it won\u2019t be too bad because our bodies would be able to fight it before it gets out of hand. do you think if you have immunity you are safe to be around vulnerable people because you can\u2019t infect them? what degree of immunity would allow you to feel safe around others? there is no guarantee you would not shed virus and be contagious again, and whether this is related to the degree of immunity you have. what types of immunity are there? natural active immunity occurs when we are exposed to a pathogen, develop a disease and then develop immunity against it such as measles, mumps, or influenza. this is also known as adaptive immunity and is unique to vertebrates. natural passive immunity occurs during pregnancy when antibodies are passed from mother to fetus through the placenta or through breast milk to an infant. this is temporary and helps infants fight infections for the first few weeks or months of life until its own immune system is fully developed. breast feeding, when possible, is really important to the health of an infant. natural passive immunity is also used when someone receives medical injections of gamma globulins. artificial immunity occurs when the body is given immunity by providing intentional exposure to a disease with small quantities or parts of the pathogen, such as with a live vaccine or a killed vaccine. this occurs with diseases such as measles and the flu. you can develop immunity against the measles or influenza by receiving the vaccines or by being exposed to the diseases. we know immunity to measles is for a lifetime, whether you are exposed to the pathogen and develop the disease or you receive a vaccination, whereas immunity to the flu lasts for about a year whether you get the flu vaccine or get the flu. in either case of the flu you are open to getting it again the following year. how does immunity develop? we are born with innate immunity, a non-specific combination of physical, chemical, and cellular defenses to prevent pathogens from entering our body. think of tears when you get something in your eye, sneezing or coughing when you get something in your nose or lungs, and fevers. other organisms in nature also have innate immunity, think of plants that are poisonous to eat or the tentacles of a jellyfish. our white blood cells, known as leukocytes, are either phagocytes that surround and absorb pathogens and effectively eat them or they are lymphocytes known as b and t cells. the adaptive immune system involves the production of b and t cells. these cells are both made in the bone marrow but must mature to become activated. the letters represent where in the body these cells mature, b cells mature in the bone marrow while t cells are transported and mature in the thymus gland. as b cells or t cells are produced, they are cloned to specifically target the pathogen they have detected. once matured they live longer in our bodies providing that long-term immunity we all hope for, so we don\u2019t get infected with the same disease twice. as b cells produce antibodies, these remain in our blood and provide protection from future infections. b cells fight bacteria and viruses by making antibodies which lock onto their target and hang on until other immune cells can destroy the invader. there are two types of t cells, helper t cells and killer t cells. just as the names imply, helper t cells communicate with other cells particularly triggering the b cells to produce antibodies and alerting other leukocytes, while killer t cells destroy cells that have already been infected. yes, they kill our own cells to get rid of invaders and work particularly well fighting viruses. distinctions without value if you have a similar disease to let\u2019s say covid-19 and get cross immunity from a different pathogen is that natural or is that artificial? does it matter? what does matter how long immunity lasts and the degree to which it protects you does matter. understanding the type of immunity and what triggers each is critical to understanding why an alternative to vaccination with a competitive disease could be beneficial against sars-cov-2 and covid-19. sources how the immune system works: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101 classifying immunities lumen boundless microbiology https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/classifying-immunities/ the history of vaccines: https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/passive-immunization",

(i keep looking out of the window to try and work out the distance in the air, lol). if we just had a flu pandemic, i'd have the window open without a second thought as i would imagine it's unlikely flu virus could travel that far and if it did, low probability that i would actually pick enough up on my hands via the desk as i wash them regularly anyway, and clean the desk regularly. also i would think the fresh air would make my lungs healthier. i love that you guys take all those measures just for colds and flu. at least you are not infecting others if you're that careful. i had a bad flu in january (still wondering if it was covid as i knew it was a 'bad flu' and wondered at the time if i'd got h1n1 or something). i believe i caught it off my neighbour when we were talking in the communal garden (only a foot apart), he'd been ill for 2 weeks by then so of course i thought he just had a residual cough. it could have been covid. he saw me the other day in the street and said he's being careful but thinks that virus we had in jan was covid. it might be worth mentioning to your partner that apart from the above, i hadn't had colds or flu for around 8 years. i didn't take any special measures although i am a hand washer when i get home, shoes off by the front door (not worn in the house) and i'm very conscious about not putting my fingers in my eyes, nose or mouth, but that's it. mobile phone would get cleaned occasionally, but i must admit, if there was a nasty flu going around i would use an alcohol wipe on the phone. thanks for your thoughts and i welcome any further about the window, lol. i should say, my neighbour has to walk past that window as he goes downstairs, but i'm not worried there as i'd only want it open on my work from home days, so he would be out at work then anyway.",

        "content": "social distancing is required as a survival tactic to prevent the spread of covid-19, but we're all still going to need to go grocery shopping at some point. the trick is to do it safely, without unnecessarily risking chance of infection to yourself or spreading the virus to others. since i'm heading off to the store later today, i figured i'd assemble some of what i've picked up as must have do's and don'ts on getting the supermarket grocery shopping done while staying safe. first - go only if you must first and foremost, go grocery shopping as little as possible. if you can limit your number of trips to the store, you'll limit your exposure. go solo. do not bring others with you unless you have to. limiting exposure to just yourself reduces the chance of carrying the virus home or infecting others while out. what to bring bring hand sanitizer / germicide and use it on your hands and on the shopping cart before and after you're finished shopping. avoid handling cash if you can, bring and use credit or debit options. this reduces the amount of direct interactions you have to have with the checkout person. there are two schools of thought on reusable bags right now. there are bag shortages at some stores, so bringing them could be smart. but if you don't disinfect your bags, and don't plan on disinfecting them before you go to the store, leave them at home during the pandemic. what to buy look for shelf-stable nutritious foods that will keep a long time, and that make filling meals. dried beans, pasta, canned goods, rice, legumes/beans, peanut butter are top priority. don't hoard what you don't plan on using within 2 weeks. grocery stores and pharmacies will remain operational. try to buy what you can integrate into your usual routine, rather than unusual items that you'd not otherwise go for. dry, cured meats, canned meats and fish, frozen vegetables and fruits are great additions. freeze fresh meats for later use. potatoes, carrots, and cabbage will last a long time in the refrigerator. don't hoard water. your tap and filters will still work perfectly fine. this isn't an earthquake or hurricane, the water will continue to flow to your home. don't hoard toilet paper. you can do away with nearly all of your toilet paper by adding a bidet to your commode. pick one up on relatively inexpensively from amazon or one of the home improvement stores to install with a minimum of handiness. treat yourself with a sparkling clean butt. how to shop for groceries do not crowd the aisles. be mindful and patient of where others are. use the self-checkout option if it is available. keep a minimum of 6 feet away from other people. use the \"two shopping cart\" rule, and don't come within two shopping cart's length of each other. this will require patience if someone is looking over food that you want to buy. if the store allows for pickup or delivery to your door or curbside, that's the most preferable. be prepared to accept substitutes if your preferred brands are not available. look, but don't touch! don't touch anything in the grocery store / supermarket until you've decided affirmatively to buy it. you can assume that anything you pick up will have been touched by a minimum of 10 other people before you, just to get it on the shelves. for those in the united states, avoid purchasing items marked wic - as these are items approved for the women, infants, children program for low income families and there may not be substitutes. be utmost kind and generous to the checkout cashier, stockers, and service staff. however rough this is for you, this is considerably more difficult for them. when to shop for groceries go in the off-hours if you can. the fewer people present, the lower the chance of infection. check with your local store for adjusted hours before you go. many stores have limited their usual hours of operation due to the pandemic. if you do have your groceries delivered, don't do a direct hand-off. instead, have them placed on your door step or into the car. for deliveries, be patient as most services are experiencing very high demand. after you finish shopping for groceries wash your hands before you leave for the store. use hand sanitizer or sanitizing wipes before you get in your car to drive away from the store. wash your hands immediately upon returning home from the store. before putting your food away, give it a once-over with a sanitizing wipe, or paper towel with disinfectant or soap. according to the bbc, coronavirus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours. take that into account before shelving that box of cheez-its. rinse the produce you buy with running water. for hard-skinned stuff, scrub. for leafy greens, a quick soak and rinse. did you wash your hands? you cannot wash your hands enough. wash your hands after you've put your shopping away. follow these handy tips, and you should be better protected and safer during your trip to the local supermarket. happy (and safe) shopping, friends! -joe edit: updated to include the latest information on how to handle produce after purchasing.",

(from another article on the manufacture of the vaccine) after calves had been inoculated with smallpox, the lymph containing white blood cells which fight against disease are extracted and preserved in capillary tubes. this is then used to vaccinate people against smallpox. calf lymph replaced the human kind in 1898 as human lymph spread other infections, such as syphilis. the vaccine was made by the jenner institute for calf lymph ltd. instead of spending millions and years of effort to develop a virtual vaccine, you would think those responsible would be harvesting the white blood cells from those who were infected and survived and using that to vaccinate people against covid-19. now, i know that we have many smart researchers working on this problem and obiously they know some reason why this approach will not work in this and other similar cases. so, does anyone have any insight into this? thanks clan",

        "content": "we\u2019re so used to pushing through flu season that we often forget that influenza is actually quite dangerous. every year, about 56,000 people die from it (this is a rough estimate as it\u2019s notoriously difficult to track specifically flu-related deaths). with numbers like that, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that most other diseases that emerge are not quite so deadly. so, where does the coronavirus stand as far as comparisons with the flu? 1. the coronavirus doesn\u2019t seem to affect kids much. first and foremost, the flu is more serious when it infects children and those over 65. weak immune systems are to blame for much of the severity, though even those who are healthy can be hit hard. so far, the coronavirus doesn\u2019t seem to infect children as much as the flu does. kids who have been infected experience very mild symptoms, whereas the cases that are more serious tend to happen to those over 40. 2. when comparing death toll, the coronavirus has not been as deadly or serious. while we don\u2019t yet have yearly figures for the coronavirus (and to be honest we really don\u2019t want to get to that point), so far the death toll is at 2,770 worldwide, most of which occurred in china. the flu, on the other hand, hovers at over 300,000 deaths worldwide based on yearly averages. 3. we know less about the coronavirus. when discussing how dangerous a disease is, one aspect you have to take into consideration is how much we know about it. it stands to reason that a lesser known disease will be more dangerous simply because we can\u2019t anticipate the damage it might cause. the coronavirus is being seen in humans for the first time, and we don\u2019t even know which animal it originated in just yet. so, in this context, the coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu because we haven\u2019t been able to study it to the extent we\u2019ve studied influenza. until we do, those unknowns are going to keep coronavirus at the top of the list of concerns.",
