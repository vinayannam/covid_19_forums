          "hi bud, we do sound as though we have very similar symptoms. i am 2 months into the end of my isolation period. the muscle aching came and went with in 3-4 weeks, the neuropathy (warm and tingling feet at night) stopped 11 days ago now which has really helped my sleeping. the twitching is only when i sit down or lie down and i too was having some shaking in my left arm but that has subsided a lot. i would say the twitching is much less than it was around 2 weeks ago so i am hoping it will resolve itself. also, its seens to be mainly in my calves and thighs now. it does happen else where in my body but much less than beforei had blood tests done 3 weeks ago and they all came back ok, i am seeing my doctor for the first time on tuesday so will see what comes from that."

( whic never worked) and an occasional cough with a feeling something stuck in my throat.the next stage was this and adomin issues i had a burning up feeling it was mainly covering the right side of the area including kidney area .. i got via 111 a cv field exam ( not tested). there, the doc thought it was an infection ... and gave antibs. this has cleared most up that was 4 weeks ago ..i still getting regular on off coughing and phlegm - i can go a few days without then its back... i also have a peppery taste which i cant get rid off this too comes and goes.. all the above is from day 1 . in addition to that i suffer from lethargy , do 2hrs work and im a sleep again! i also get hot flushes which dont last long ..i'm usually quite fit and active, not overweight and no underlying health issues. i am getting fed up with this have no idea what is going on, or when i'm going to recover. im thinking of going back and having a cv test colin",

          "thank you, my friend. it truly is bizarre. most people i know who have tested positive had no symptoms at all, but there are some who have had it even longer than me (2 months +) who still feel the chest or have a cough, etc. i guess the only answer for now is to keep taking it easy and taking our vitamins. i hope you and everyone else here have good news in very near future.",

          "please do bear in mind that i'm not a doctor but here goes:1) sleeping on your chest is helpful if you are having issues with phlegm and clearing the muck out. your lungs are mainly in the rear half of your torso so if you lie down and sleep or cough it can drive the phlegm deeper down (bad) instead of out (good). if you have medical advice to not sleep like this then obviously follow the doctor. in icu they will often put patients like this to help them shift it.2) the colour indicates infection. if it's dark green and sticky it can mean the immune system is fighting back. my point though is if you keep track of what it looks like, you will be able to notice any changes and then inform your doctor should you feel bad. it may help them to diagnose.",

          "thanks stuart.i def think the virus has increased my nerve sensitivity. just hoping it hasn't left me very susceptible to picking up everything left right and centre. think going to have to be careful not to expose myself to too much for next month. my immune system has likely taken bit of a hammering with all this. think that's why have picked up an infection.",
          "if you take zinc, should also take a \"zinc ionophore\" like quercetin or egcg. which sound scary until you realize it means green tea, black tea, apples, and onions, for example.so then you don't have to take too much zinc, which can be a problem.for that matter you can get zinc from dietary sources, generally red meat, nuts, and you can look up more stuff.",
          "good spot on the furry teeth. i thought it was unrelated and just me. sorry for kicking off the phlegm chat but my gp said the colour is an indication of infection. if it's green you may have pneumonia so call the gp. i read somewhere this virus hides out in the saliva glands which explains why it's so 'productive'. anyway enough of that! i had 2 good days and went to bed last night fully expecting a drop today. as expected, less good this morning but i'm ready for it. don't let it break your mood, your mental health affects your immune response. it's really heartening to have found comrades in this. res - you need to get that tooth checked out. i don't think it's going to go with pills. and don't worry if you don't have phlegm issues (julie i think?) - it's just a symptom and we can be thankful for the ones we don't get. be safe folks.",

          "hi lulu,we sound quite similar. this is starting week 5 for me. i am up and about, feeling good for a few days and then back down again. for some odd reason my throat and neck become really sore by the end of the day, one day my chest hurts, next days its fine. it is very depressing as there is no one able to tell you that this is going to be ok, but the more time goes by the better, im sure, we will all be. i wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks, but its just a case of getting through them. hoping more information/treatment will be available soon",
          "hi julieyes we seem on similar paths. i have found talking too much on the phone makes a huge difference to my throat by the end of day so am now limiting to one call a day now! i had terrible pain in my right lung last week which has now subsided (too scared to say gone!). i literally feel the anxiety rising as it gets dark and have been sleeping in spare room as i toss and turn all night - checking on my breathing/chest pain and eventually fall asleep at around 4.00 in the morning. i do think the anxiety exacerbates some of the symptoms but it is hard not to feel anxious when you are on this roller coaster and no idea what the day is going to bring. i do quite a bit of yoga and at the moment literally just lie on my mat and breathe. i was also told by my doc to drink neat lemon juice for the vit c hit and to cut through the gunk in my throat. i hope today is a good day for you and things improve.",
          "hi lulusorry you are so unwell with this virus. i'm in week 6 and have some of the same symptoms as you. i started with a very sore throat, then developed breathing problems, a sore/tight chest, and my nose became completely blocked.nights are the worse time and i have to sleep sitting up because of breathing difficulties. often i have to get up for a bit which seems to help. i am unable to speak much on the phone, mainly because of breathing problems now, as my sore throat seems to be almost better.when my chest is sore i find a warm compress is giving me some relief. breathing exercises have helped me a lot with breathlessness, nose unblocking and relaxation.i hope you will start to feel better soon, it happens so gradually though, and is a mixture of good/bad days",
          "hi lulu. you will get there. it's horrible. all your symptoms the way you describe was exactly how i have been. i felt it was never going to go.breathing at night was hard and frightening, i just wished for morning again. i am now on my 5th week but i am glad to say i can finally say i am feeling better. the last two days i have noticed the change and am able to breathe more clearly and easily...what a relief it is!!i still lack energy but each day its coming slowly. i am just wanting to reassure you all, you will get there. as i say, thought i'd never get to this stage. a week ago i was sitting in a hospital bed in a&e thinking the worst, now feeling like the last 4 weeks just been one big blur!! keep persevering, you will get better. xx",
          "thank you it has made me feel so much better hearing from everyone - i felt so alone with this and thought maybe i was just not coping well but reading these posts is just so reassuring. i also had my nose completely blocked just at the time when you need to breath through it.",
          "thank you gemma, that is so reassuring i have been feeling so low and worn out with it but today has been quite good so far. i am not too worried about the tiredness but it is the breathing that has been freaking me out but hopefully having heard from so many lovely people who have taken the time to reply i will relax a bit tonight and manage to get some sleep. the anxiety at night definitely makes things worse."

          "thank you for posting this michael - i've just received a negative test but still feeling horrible. i'm on day 29 and although not technically breathless, i have some difficulty breathing due to what feels like stuck phlegm - if i shift it, the sensation goes. throughout my experience i did not experience a temperature or a typical cough and this sensation appeared a couple of weeks ago, although a subsequent chest x-ray was normal. my main symptoms were gastrointestinal and racing heart rate . i've had a couple of good days on and off but haven't felt great this past couple of days - i will speak to my gp tomorrow and will mention your post - if this is part of the recovery process then it's easier to deal with as opposed to the fear that this is going to turn nasty at any point. i'd also feel more relaxed if people in our situations were monitored more regularly. take care"

          "thanks for your contributions michael. i've found them both helpful and anxiety reducing. i'm probably half way through my 8th week since symptoms began. i teach in an international college in the uk and had a lot of chinese kids with persistent coughs, some of them masked up since january. i have asthma/copd so i'm in the 'shielding' category, working from home teaching online. i've had no cough but quite a bit of recurrent breathlessness. it's been a lot worse than the mild late-onset asthma i suffer from. testing wasn't available outside of a&e when i first felt unwell. my gps have said it's not worth having a test now as i would be past the infectious stage and nothing would show. i had a course of antibiotics just in case it was something else, but they think it's most likely covid. they subscribe to the post viral inflammation view and i start a short course of prednisone today, to see if that helps. i'll let everyone know how i get on. thanks once again; it's reassuring to hear that we're not so atypical.",

          "hi everyone , i m also in week 6 now and experiencing many of the symptoms you describe . feeling ok for a while then awful again , wondering when it will ever stop . breathlessness , racing heart , tight chest , phlegm , anxiety when i cant breathe well after all this tim e . spoken to several dr s , some are reassuring some clueless . just started 2 nd course of antibiotics to cover any secondary infection . my brother just sent me this from the guardian . https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/lingering-and-painful-long-and-unclear-road-to-coronavirus-recovery-long-lasting-symptoms?",

          "yes, i can relate, day 11 for me. i started feeling a bit breathless going up ans down stairs, felt very tired lost sense of smell/taste upset stomach and although i have been drinking pints of water always feel dry. lost appetite i am forcing bits of soup or porridge down, also have strange jumpiness more evident when i try to relax an have some sleep. i have tense feeling of what seems like anxiety and have noticed i have been shaky most of the time.for the past couple of days left side of chest feels heavy and i expect that will become the main issue in the next few days. feeling of impending doom, feeling quite weepy. there does not seem to be anyone who is able to sort anything out we are just left to make our own way through and not everyone of us has a mild experience.",
          "hi alisoni experienced the shakiness, anxiety stomach issues and sense of impending doom too. i also have not had a proper night's sleep since i got sick. the issue is that, in usual circumstances, we'd get medical support and attention and, as you said, we're very much left on our own to get through - unless things take a turn for the worse. many of us on here have had symptoms for weeks - i'm now entering week 6 - most gps are saying that it could take a couple of months to be back to normal - this group is a comfort because we understand each other.it might be worth getting, if you haven't already, a pulse oximeter which will give you some indication of your blood oxygen levels and do not hesitate to get checked over if you feel worried. hopefully everything will rectify itself and you won't have to endure week after week of this. however, you are not alone and this site will be a great help.wishing you all the best, take care xx",

          "think we all feel like a nuisance right now\ud83d\ude02 .have to just hope some of these trials come off and they have some meds that will be put out into the general population soon.also, once lockdowns are over i imagine if anyone is experiencing longer term problems they can push for ct scans to check more specifically for any lung damage etc.there's been a few cases i've read about where covid was not showing up on xray but was showing up on ct...not sure why that is..it usually would show up on xray though if it was a problematic pneumonia which i guess is why a lot of people admitted for breathing have positive xrays..so it's still good to get a clear xray i guess. hope you have better days to come. hope we all do. i will be 6 weeks on monday.",
          "oh no! i thought a clear x-ray was good news - my gp seemed to think it was. i'm worried that if i were to have another one it would be different - i'm going to hve to find a way of going back to a&e- there's just so little clarity on this and i don't know whether i should be trusting what my drs are saying. people like us really should be monitored.",
          "i think a clear x-ray def is a good sign! it's just that i've read of cases where the x-ray was clear and the ct scan was not...but those were interestingly not cases that ended up in a bad way in hospital for covid breathing difficulties. one guy actually had testicular pain and stomach pain..was a weird one! they accidentally spotted the spots in his lower lungs that the x-ray had not picked up when they did a ct but he was presenting with different symptoms entirely . his breathing was fine.i think if you have this virus though in the way that ends up with not being able to breath independently and hospitalised then it is most likely your x-ray would not be clear..so do be reassured! def not suggesting a chest x-ray is useless. it's very useful. i had one and i take it as a good sign that my chest pain is probably mainly inflammation at this point. i think they just don't have resources to monitor those of us who are struggling but not critical. not just resources, but actual ability to treat this. at this point their hands are tied. trials are in process for drugs but nothing cleared. the best they can do is give oxygen if you need it and if you don't give you prohylactic antibiotics and hope for the best. it's def not perfect but we are just unlucky to be in the first round of a pandemic. everyone's learning on the job..them and us.",
          "thanks res - i'm having a bad night so i found this reassuring!very valid points - we really are in the unknown and let's hope some of these trials are successful. however, looking at post-viral impact of other viral illnesses , that can be just as debilitating as the actual illness. take care - here's to a better day tomorrow x",

          "yeah, the duo and down nature is the cruel bit actually. from day 6 it was up and down.it's only the last solid week that for me it's been more ups than downs but i'm week 6 to get to that place even.it wears on your patience in the end.i think.i just be improving though because today it hit me that i felt quite bored...which i remember thinking 3 weeks ago that i wished i even felt bored..so i see that as improvement!i not well enough yet to do anything about being bored but hopefully that will come. have to say i'm glad they lifted the ban on ibuprofen as i feel its helped me as far as inflammation goes. the first 3 weeks without it were a struggle.",
          "yep its definitely up and down and it seems to last a long time. ive been eating really well with lots of vitamins. i think its true what you said about alcohol, i havent been drinking, but a couple of times i had some beer and felt worse for a couple of days. i am tired all the time, but its the breathlessness that really bothers me. i have a finger oximeter and my oxygen levels are pretty normal. its quite comforting to know people are having similar symptoms.",
          "thanks for answering res do you think that ibuprofen would be any better for the throat i think if i can sort that out i will be getting somewhere got all the normal stuff nothing seems to kick it have a good evening guys and girls don't worry about the ibuprofen checked it says paracetamol for throat oh well that doesn't seem to work must have gone immune to it",
          "this is news to me - i thought ibuprofen was still off the list although i haven't checked in weeks. for any asthmatics do be aware that ibuprofen can aggravate your symptoms so check with your gp.i can attest to the alcohol again - i've made that mistake 3 times (last time was literally 2 beers) and each time i pay for days. alcohol does damage the epithelial cells so it makes sense.i forgot to mention one relief method that i don't use but have been told it's beneficial - an electric diffuser/humidifier. they are about 20 quid on amazon (all shapes and sizes though). do any of you have such a machine and does it help? i was thinking about getting one for night time as i wake up as dry as a pharaoh's sock.",

          "that's interesting david at least sooner or later they're going to have to address this because of lock down my virtual hospital doctor told me that he has another 100 people who he calls every other day to check on whom are taking a lot longer to recover but that in itself is good news because he used the word recover",
          "yes, humidifier works wonders. make sure you either empty every morning and let air dry completely or i learned a trick to add a tablespoon or 2 of hydrogen peroxide to the tank if you forget. eliminates any bacterial growth. also i started using cbd a few days ago and i haven't had any racing heart issues since. that and really listening to my body when it says slow down. i still dont feel 100% but haven't had any setbacks in almost a week. is cbd easily accessible in the u.k.?",

        "content": "hello everyone, i didnt see this post yesterday and started a thread about my symptoms so thought id post on here too sorry to hear youve all been so poorly. ive added some more info from my original post. almost 8 weeks i\u2019ve been ill. it started with a bit of a tight chest, no cough, no temperature. a couple of days later and my chest started to feel raw and sore just assumed i had a virus ....probably covid. my chest started to burn constantly all day long the burning lasted 3.5 weeks. then sharp pains felt like it was flipping from one side of my chest to the other, also felt like the burning went down to my tummy area. also had some mild diarrhea and terriible wind! sore throat and sore raw nose! shortness of breath begun day 7. sometimes it was so bad i had to really concentrate on my breathing to catch my breath. also my heart rate has been through the roof as soon as i move, walk a little it goes really high like i\u2019m fast walking/jogging etc 145bpm feel dizzy. week 2 started with the hot night sweats! waking up like i\u2019m on fire. sweating awful body odour-i don\u2019t suffer with this normally. ive had a temperature that comes and goes. around 38.3 but now settling around the 37.3 which is high for me im usually 36.3. still having the hot sweats week 7... every night. also had facial flushing, headaches and body aches. i was given antibiotics after 3 weeks incase. i went to the hospital as the doctors said it couldn\u2019t be covid as it was going on too long. i had a chest x-ray and a ct of my lungs that was clear. they ruled out a pe blood clot in lungs as they first suspected this. sent home. i wondered if the virus has caused some sort of gastric issues and that the burning is due to severe acid reflux?. something i\u2019ve never suffered from only when pregnant. the burning pain now has only been in my chest. thats why i never suspected it to be acid reflux as when i had it only when pregnant i had it come into my throat and thats not happened with this illness. i\u2019m now on omeprazole 40mg for 2 weeks. the burning in chest and pain in my back has eased. im wondering if it even is acid reflux now. i\u2019m now left with some chest pains left and right side and back pain but the high heart rate upon walking around my house has not gone away nor has the acute breathlessness. has anyone had high heart rate, maybe severe gastric issues eg oesophagitus and shortness of breath , hot sweats with this illness? can\u2019t take much more of this. im 39 on no meds no heath condtions usually active mum of 4! ive never been this ill for this long in my life! i had a test for covid 19 a week ago as i was admitted to hospital for the night that was negative not surprised tho as it was 7 weeks since symptoms first began. doctors now saying post viral. but its very comforting to read your stories as initially they said it couldnt be that because its gone on so long. i as other people have mentioned dont understand why its taking so long to recover when boris is now back at work. my partner had to stop work to look after the kids for a month while i was in bed! its been a nightmare as my youngest is only 3. i was hoping to do jo wicks with the kids but no chance of that. haha .",

          "you've been through the wars like most of us on here stef and you're at eight weeks so you should start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel because my doctor told me it could last eight weeks i'm coming up to 7 and starting to feel a bit better can't say that every day because little sugar comes back and kicks me i think it affects a lot of people differently you just hang in there young lady keep fighting and you will get there",
          "exactly my symptoms for 3 weeks now. some days a bit better, and then going back to feeling really crappy again. i started taking a women's multivitamin, 4 capsules of vitamin d, a calcium pill with vitamin d in it, and a probiotic first thing in the morning. it really helped - i felt good up until afternoon or early evening, so i started taking additional couple of pills of vitamin d and a calcium pill in the evening and it made a big difference. then i added resistant starch - 3 spoonfulls of potato starch mixed in a glass of cranberry or pineapple juice, and that took care of the digestive problems. i now feel better than i have in weeks. i drink cranberry and pineapple juices all day long as they really help with the burning, and they give me energy with the vitamin c in them. your body needs some extra vitamins and stuff to fight it off. give it a try and let me know if it helps you, too. make sure when you buy the cranberry juice that it is actual cranberry juice. at least here, most \"cranberry juices\" are cocktails of apple, grape and other juices with very little actual cranberry in them. good luck!",
          "hi there. thank you for your reply. i hope you feel better soon. yes this virus does appear to be cyclical. one day i feel a little better do a bit more and then bam ive gone back 3 days. its brutal!",
          "thank you, i will try the juices and ive not been eating well so a good boost of vitamins is definitely much needed too. hope you continue to improve and get well soon.",
          "hi stefsounds like you've had an awful time and must be so hard with 4 children to think about too - ive struggled and ive just had myself to think about. as i said in another reply i am 6/7 weeks in and have had all the chest pain and back pain and i really think this is the aftermath and is inflammation of the lining of the chest and lung walls (check pleurisy) and also have similar in my throat. it is worse the more i do so have now decided the only course i can take is to rest in between everything i do. i don't think boris is properly back at work - i think boris is resting up and easing back gently he has only done one press conference and probably is feeling like the rest of us but doesn't want people to think he is not running the country so does the odd appearance and throws out the odd tweet! wishing you well and keep in touch on here it really helps.",
          "stef, also meant to say i have the fast heart rate and the breathlessness still - my heart rate goes sky high if i go upstairs, prior to this i was swimming fifty lengths a day, doing yoga and generally dashing around. i too have no underlying health issues, have bmi of 20.9 and never been so ill in my life. take care.",
          "hi lulu, thank you for your reply. its really so debilitating isn't it. i myself so busy and active and a bmi in the normal range. may i ask have you had a chest xray? its so strange because ive got this racing heart/breathlessness but lungs look clear they said! maybe they were inflamed. yesterday i had some shopping delivered and while i was putting it away my heart went to 145 felt dizzy and breathless and had to keep sitting down so like you say maybe rest inbetween doing small jobs. hope you feel better very soon.",
          "it's truly awful - i haven't had a chest x-ray my doctor said he would send me for one but then added if i were one of his family and thought things were improving he would avoid going to the hospital unless absolutely necessary. my heart rate has been up to 135 and have to do some deep slow breathing to settle it down - i don't think the anxiety helps either so have been working on that too. i know it must be so hard for you to rest with 4 children but i think it is essential as the lungs have to repair and it seems to take a long time - i have been doing short walks but i am not sure if that is helping or not but don't feel i can just sit around all day. i make sure i take it really easy after the walk just sitting in sun or lying on sofa - will end up with a good sun tan if nothing else! take care, update us tomorrow if you get a chance.",
          "its so frustrating isn't it to rest rest rest. ive been trying to do more but i keep going back days / weeks if i do too much. but i guess its what our body needs. sunbathing and a nice dose of vitamin d will definitely help- good idea. ive gone back after trying to do a few small jobs round the house over the last few days. the hot sweats came back with a vengeance. wishing you well.",
          "how much of vitamin d do you take please, i mean dosage wise not number of capsules?",
          "i take the multivitamin, calcium and 3 capsules of vitamin d (5000 iu) and a probiotic supplement in the morning. it gives me energy but by late afternoon, i start feeling tired again, so i take another 2 pills of d. in addition to that, i drink pineapple and cranberry juices that have a lot of vitamin c in them, and when ever my diarrhea comes back, i take the potato starch mixed in juice. i've been doing this for about 5 days now, and last night my heart rate was normal - went from over 100 beats/minute to less than 80, which is normal. this is definitely helping. i feel hundred times better now. still coughing, and still weak, especially in the afternoon and evening, but my energy is coming back. it looks like it takes a while to get this completely overwith. i'm still coughing, but no raw or hurting throat. my sinuses are good now, no more stuffy nose or sinus pain. still short of breath when walking uphill or something like that, but i finally feel that i'm getting better. your body needs a lot of boosting to kill the virus. good luck! i hope you feel better soon."

          "omg! poor thing. try taking the vitamin d, but also blow your nose and when ever you cough up something, spit it out. this virus lives in your digestive system, too - its been found in feces, tears, and even semen, so you need to do what you can not to swallow it. taking the potato starch mixed in juice helped my stomach a lot. i know it sounds ridiculous, but its an old trick to treat diarrhea. in addition to that, i saw a list of almost 300 studies around the world in different hospitals, testing different drugs and homeopathic remedies. 3 studies were studying the effect of resistant starches against this virus. they are still studying, so no results yet, but i was feeling so bad that i figured it won't hurt me to add probiotics and the potato starch. i have no idea which one helped, or maybe its the combination of all of it, but since i started taking all this and drinking a lot of juice with vitamin c in it, i have been feeling a little bit better every day. it worked for me and i truly hope that it will work for you, too."

          "hi mark had the throat issue too and pretty certain nothing to do with acid reflux i think this virus causes inflammation as it travels through the body and the pain now people are dealing with after several weeks is the residual inflammation whether it is in throat, lungs, stomach - probably why it is worse if you overdo it - this is just my take on it but if worried of course speak to gp again . i too have had two courses of antibiotics and a course if anti mucous to help get the phlegm up. i think the key is keeping hydrated and resting as much as possible even when you have good days. take care.",
          "try mixing potato starch in juice, a couple of spoonfuls in a glass of cranberry or pineapple juice. that helped me with the diarrhea and with the acids. also, since you have been on antibiotics twice, its a good idea to take some probiotics to get the right kind of bacteria growing in your gut. antibiotics kill a lot of the good bacteria. good luck, and i hope you feel better soon.",

          "hi garygood news re: x-ray. scary situation though , we're all going through it at the moment. did the a&e dr offer any medical opinion or advice ? i'm finding that ringing my gp ends up with them paying lip service and basically telling me to manage it myself. however, taking action now, checking heart and lungs, and prescribing something to manage inflammation - could avoid any future chronic condition which will burden the health service. we just don't know whether this is a likely outcome.hope you have a good day. take care xx",
          "morning! that sounds reassuring to me that the breathlessness is the tail end of the body repairing/recovering and not still the active virus or damage to chest/lungs done by the virus. its good to be checked out and reassured. the antibiotics will help you on your way to recovery every day you are one day further away from the illness and one day nearer recovery. i have switched off from all news/press updates and articles unless my partner reads first and tells me they will help me and are not scary. ive read articles in past and literally felt my body going into panic and anxiety mode. just one comment or depressing story from someone can set me off! things will get better it is just a long/slow process. here's to a positive day. wishing you better.",
          "to be honest dee i went to a and e because i felt that my gp was either worried themselves or only giving me the best advice for my symptoms or as you say manage it yourself i've stayed away from the media because of basically the same reason they in my opinion are governed by others obviously they will get some things right it's the law of averages but to be able to help me no i was scared so i went to a and e to tell you the truth i felt better when i was there even though others around me were dealing with whatever they had i wanted to go home knowing i had tried something my gp would have been next stop and will be if these antibiotics do not work got to work on the dehydration as well hope that helps gary",
          "your exactly right with what you say and what you are doing lulu i put the remote in the bin \ud83d\ude02 no i still watch programs or films just will do that and work on each symptoms i'm praying the antibiotics work if not then my gp will be next or i will have a chat with the pharmacy one by one i and you will get there keep on kicking little sugar gary",

          "to tell you the truth susan i'm not sure they took me where they done the swabs and xrays last time there was a couple of trainees there but they were looking after a patient who had a problem with prostate they done the xray checked oxygen levels and there was a young girl there who had breathing trouble all looked like they were worried about touching everything changing gloves a lot so no lack of ppe gary",
          "sounds like green zone that's good",
          "think you're right res the two main things they asked me were the breathlessness and tempature i've not really had a problem with the tempature woke up sometimes sweaty don't like the breathlessness but then i was negative so maybe it has been a chest infection all this time it's not right when people can't get to see someone when they need to but also saying that more and more people worried about going to a and e at the moment probably why it's virtually empty"

          "1. ears constantly blocked over the 8 weeks (and more blocked when feel worse to the point of hearing distortion)haven't had blocked ears, but my tinnitus have been worse. i've always had episodes where the volume of my tinnitus seems to go up for a few seconds. but after i had the virus i've had a lot more of those episodes and they often last longer than usual as well.2. have never had a persistent cough.i've never had a cough. i have had the odd episode with either a single cough or the need to clear my throat, but it's only been a few times so not worth mentioning really.3. tingly sensations that come and go up and down the spine region sprecifically (first 10 days was based solely in the bottom of the neck area, third wave was based specifically far lower down at base of spine)haven't had those.4. literal switch on and switch off of appetite - when its off coincides with feeling less well.haven't had that5. for the last few weeks of back chest pains associated sensations of burning /heat (like chines burns) in both upper arms.haven't had that either",
          "unfortunately all of the above for me...but the tingling has been left side of face shoulder, arm and hand.that turned into a gripping pain and muscle jolting at night. ears have been on and off, appetite inland off, mainly off..and burning in chest and tightness that comes and goes.i've had a cough but it's not been a terrible cough. that has by far been the easiest symptoms actually.the antibiotics are probably only helping because they are anti inflammatory and this virus causes a lot of long term inflammation .really hope it gets easier for you. your time line is almost the same as mine."

          "thanks everyone!to answer your questions garry, maciej, i've been prescribed a ventolin inhaler - i can't say whether it has made a massive difference but it helped me overcome breathlessness as i began to exert myself more and more. i have tried to avoid relying on it as much as possible though. nutrition-wise i maintain a healthy diet, take a good multivitamin and a turmeric capsule. i also drink copious amounts of herbal tea which keeps me hydrated and calm - my favourite being a \"turmeric active\" tea which contains turmeric, ginger and something called galangal (no idea what this is but it tastes great). honestly, i can't stress this enough, tea has been a god-send.. how very british :') before bed i have taken up meditation to overcome the anxiety evenings often bring (10 - 20 mins) - i don't *need* to do it now, but it doesn't half give me a good night's sleep! having said that, it can be hard to focus on breathing when it's the very thing causing you distress... but eventually i got the hang of it.i found peace of mind while exercising too, i wouldn't overdo it, but i feel as though it's helping me bring my lungs slowly back into check too. if you have any other questions feel free to ask but i know your bodies will get the upper-hand soon enough!best,michael",
          "amazing news michael so happy for you and thank you for sharing! after 7 weeks i too have felt much more stable over the last ten days and seem to have overcome the anxiety (obviously as feeling better makes you feel more positive). i have been reading the power of now - not normally my type of read but my son suggested it as i was so anxious about what might happen - it has really helped and also do my yoga which at moment mainly consists of lying on mat and breathing and a few stretches but hope to progress to back where i was before this. i still have breathlessness but manageable and the pain in my right lung has now moved to the left! i finish my penicillin tomorrow so feel a bit nervous but if i feel any slip in the wrong direction will be straight on to gp. i take my oxygen levels, heart rate and blood pressure once a day and note them as i can see them improving. we have a full medical suite around here!i agree with the tea i have stopped drinking coffee as heart rate has been raised and am now drinking either green tea or fresh lemon and honey in warm water. always conscious of eating healthily but have upped the leafy vegetables and just generally cram in anything that is good for you at every opportunity.also still drinking neat lemon juice every morning and taking vitamin d supplement and a short, flat walk for 10/15 mins a day trying to build up but can definitely feel it in my lungs and sometimes cough a bit more after - not sure if that is good or not.still a way to go but feeling more positive, keep going everyone and thank you all for your support and hopefully we can support others through this.",
          "thanks so much for your input michael it is really appreciated i like tea so will give it a go i will exercise when i feel i'm on the mend if i feel i'm having a good day it does make me feel a lot better knowing someone else is in recovery and nearly there thanks again michael",

          "glad the tip helped buddy!no allergies and no hay fever. sorry to hear you're still suffering. i still have days which are noticeably worse than others but not the the same extent as before. it seems i still have some recovering to do as well!i hope you begin to see steady improvements sometime soon (and i'm sure you will)!"

          "morning jim, sorry to hear how bad you are feeling. i dont want to jinx things but this is week 8 for me and i have had 7 days of feeling back to just about normal physically , mentally may take longer! but as weve seen from others i may slip back! but at least i can see a bit of light as once you start feeling better you gradually build up more good days than bad. my test too was negative but that was 6 weeks after symptoms started. just trying to keep positive is easier said than done but thats the best thing we can do right now. the only symptom i have left is slight cough n sore throat, but listening to dr sarah jarvis on bbc 2, she said a sore throat is not a symptom, but i have to say i have found ut really painful, with added neck and head pain, but you then start to wonder have i really had it, but i am pretty convinced i have. just hang in there, keep up paracetamol etc - it will get better .",
          "thank you julie.im struggling to be honest. prior to this ive never really been poorly.no face to face conversations, hugs, touches and kisses for nearly six weeks have had a huge impact on me on top of the virus.sorry for sounding soft but ive never been like this before.",
          "hi jim, so sorry you are still poorly. this really is the most difficult time isnt it. hang in there like julie said its small steps. so frustrating tho. ive just had my 11 year old in tears, i just keep apologising to them that im still so ill and weve all got to pull together. his 3 year old brother has attached himself to him and wont leave him alone. do you live on your own jim or are you self isolating?",
          "hi steph, the fast heart rate is awful isnt it. ive had that for the whole time. wears me out as it feels like im sprinting everywhere. hope today is a better day for you.",
          "you definitely do not sound soft, you are just very anxious and probably scared! this is without exception the scariest time i've ever been thru as you feel so alone even with family around you they just cannot help, and the medical side can do nothing. i would rather go thru my divorce 10 times over than face this again! are you in the london area?",
          "hi stef i feel that they have got it wrong about the throat i feel once i can get get rid of it and the popping in my nose i have just the anxiety and breathless to overcome and whatever storm is going on in my stomach nearly forgot the dehydration square 2 rough night due a good one may be the antibiotics coming out of my system don't know sorry to see your having a bad time jim hang on in there like me your due a few good ones",

          "hi alljim- completely agree with everyone here -you do not need to apologise. we all feel that way at some point - it doesn't help that all the information 'out there' completely underplays the symptoms and duration when it comes to 'mild-moderate' cases. this forum has been a valuable find for me - i may not contribute regularly but just knowing i'm not alone has been a help as have the different experiences and remedies.stuart has touched on a valid point about isolation -i shut myself away when i started working from home on 18 march as a precaution- little did i know a week later i'd be bedridden and confined to my room for the next month. however, a couple of weeks ago, after negative tests, drs have given the go-ahead to resume 'normal' life where possible (wish i felt well enough to) and at the encouragement of my family , i spent a lot of time with them in the garden which was a boost. i hope today is a better day for all of you, i really do.",

          "hi jim after a horrid night of palpitations and various other symptoms and not sleeping at all i took myself off to a&e . where they undertook blood tests, ecg, chest x-ray and covid test which ive never had before. they were happy with bloods and chest x-ray and surprisingly ecg as my blood pressure and pulse have both been high. won't know about covid for 48 hrs. they did leave a cannula in and and nurse said they would probably give me something to make me feel better but that didn't happen !! no magic pill for this \"sugar\" so back to self medicating with paracetamol and mucus cough syrup for phlegm which isn't moving. just feel like a burning sensation from throat down to my windpipe and ears feeling like they're going to explode !! hope everyone is having a better day.",
          "hi stef , yes i've never suffered from fast pulse or palpations before this virus its an awful feeling !! a long episode makes me feel like ive ran a marathon not that i know what that's like, it's exhausting.",
          "hi stephi have had similar problem with the burning sensation down throat, windpipe and onto chest and lungs - it has improved after 2nd lot of antibiotics but can still feel it if inhale deeply or walk up slight incline. i think (but don't know) that it is probably inflammation. i am also suffering from phlegm and am on anti mucous tablets not sure if help or not but literally cough and spit out (sorry!) everything i can just to rid it from my body. it is especially productive in a hot steamy shower. i feel i would benefit from taking ibruprofen to help the inflammation but am so scared generally that it would make it worse or have a reaction (god this illness makes you so full of anxiety) but i know others have said it helps so maybe that is my next step. also, spoke to a friend who's cousin was in hospital on oxygen for over a week - he has improved but he is far from well just been told to rest, rest and rest - so it does make you realise people do not leave hospital and just get on with life that is just the beginning of their recovery period. on the days we feel better we still need to just rest - it is hard but think it is the key. wishing everyone better x",

          "hi steph,its the first time my wife and i have been in the same room since the start this afternoon.ive watched her cut up both bedroom and bathroom carpets. the only thing ive done is put tape round the rolls as shes held them. ive put three small pieces out of the window and moved medication.im absolutely shattered.all my symptoms arr aggravated beyond belief.ive buggered myself up!!!i just wish it would finish.",
          "stephyes, i've been wondering the same thing re long term effects and trying drugs on us at some point. we can only hope they will look at this at some point. jimah, it's so tiring isn't it? listen to your body and give it the time it needs. nice you could be with your wife, even if it was for cutting up mercury-riddled carpet! hang in there x",

          "dee, its like the gp's want to see how much we can take before we break , feels like we're the guinea pigs. thing is with the trial drugs we need them now, not when we're hopefully recovered !! i know someone who's been treated with the steroids in hospital and is now over the worse and they are about same time frame as me. think we're all suffering in silence and boy are we suffering !! i agree that any exertion puts us back on the recovery scale. as on thursday i cut the grass and friday had the paramedics out !!",

          "mine started around 23 march couldn't move dehydration was bad migraines and fatigue breathlessness about the 4th day my boss said because they weren't symptoms of the virus would have to go sick over time that changed the only ones that i never had were sense of smell tempature little cough i was actually told that the swabs were not working properly by the nurse and why the doctor said chest infection is beyond me i think because it was a bit chaotic when i was there they were probably looking at getting everyone seen to never want to see another antibiotic i'm the type of person who just gets on with it but this little sugar has other ideas got some stuff sos coming today hopefully for the dehydration then i will have to work on the anxiety and breathlessness",
          "thank you maryi think that i would have preferred my test to have come back negative. i would have coped knowing that i was post viral but the thought that the virus is still live in my body has freaked me out. i am trying to stay positive but you can not get answers from anywhere. i am so grateful for your comments. we will get there x",
          "i think you can't get any answers viv because this virus is confusing a lot of doctors even had one tell me so if you give it a bit of time answers will emerge once they get the fuller picture which they will be working on now hope they get the little sugar before i do \ud83d\ude02",
          "it does seem to be baffling everyone at the moment. i hope your symptoms get easier soon gaz thank you for telling me your experience.",

          "this virus is such a slog.physically and emotionally.so sorry to hear you're having such a bad time. i am 7 weeks and 2 days in and am only this last week starting to feel anywhere near human.to give you some hope i have heard that when the virus cells are shed post virus some people are getting positives after negatives so fingers crossed that's what that is..just viral shedding..but i know sitting with a positive test result must feel very scary this far in and a lot of us here are wondering the same thing given the undulating symptom...are we or are we not still in active stages or post.very stressful times.",
          "hi viv, interesting reading your symptoms and timeline. my first two weeks weren't too bad either and it got worse from there. i was interested to know how you got a test. i would like one but i have no clue how or where to get it. hope you feel better soon.",
          "just to say...codeine is not great for the lungs..ever..and neither is diazepam..slows breathing..i'm wondering why the doctor prescribed both these? hopefully they know what they r doing!",
          "i agree with you res about the medication they gave those to viv just got mine wrong with both the symptoms and medication and it is such a slog now one day i may find out don't know but i still feel that mine started in my nose and throat and believe that little sugar is still there i had a lot better night and not as much dehydration and fatigue got some neilmed sinus rinse that i have started taking yesterday still waiting for the sos for the dehydration and will now have to try and keep working on my throat little bit anxiety yesterday breathing seems to be improving and i really do hope that we will all be able to get our answers one day as to what happened to the time that little sugar took away from us being healthy and with our families today will be try to knock another symptom off feel that the throat will be trouble for a few weeks yet it has soothed but still pops its ugly head up every so often hope whatever your dealing with today you can knock one off and the little sugar doesn't come back go for it guys and girls gary",
          "stuart if i was you i would get on to your gp and demand help to get yourself tested if not go to a and e i still feel though that will not be your best way of knowing as i have said before they are not reliable when i think back now and went to a and e the first time when it all started it was really strange because hardly anyone was there and when i took my boy the last time before that couldn't get a seat now i understand why i certainly wouldn't have wanted to catch little sugar i had a muscle spasm in my back a couple of years ago i didn't know at the time what i had done but the pain was the worst feeling ever took me a few months to get back to doing the same as i was before when i look back i would take that again rather than have little sugar because even though i am recovering now i feel i still have some way to go yet and it will be a slog when i get back to work",
          "thanks gazza. i tried a&e 4 weeks ago and they wouldn't see me due to my symptoms, but yes you are right, it's time to get back to my gp and at least let them know my situation as at the moment i feel totally on my own with this and completely ignored. by the way i am going to adopt your 'little sugar' name. it's a good way to address this damned thing!! \ud83d\ude02",

          "good to hear it stuart don't take it anymore you have to know what to do that is right for you and your body everyone of us will have different symptoms at different times when i first started i remember speaking to the virtual doctor and he said that i should keep doing what i was doing and that they couldn't work the little sugar out but i was negative eight weeks tomorrow i still have a sore throat anxiety bit of breathing problems not as bad as was little sinus trouble popping and dehydration not as much but now one litre a night but i can go back to work still feel there is a lot more gp who are still not coming to terms with the little sugar",

          "i've been ill for nearly 9 weeks now so probably won't benefit. will have to get one when i get back to work. i had a xray done and that was clear also a paramedic friend checked my lungs chest last wed and they were clear so i think it's just trying to recover now, i'm slowly doing little stuff in garden, drive out in car with hubby and walk upto my green. but i get panic attacks at mo so its a struggle to push myself to do these things, i'm on antidepressant but making me more anxious as well. my gp etc think the breathing is anxiety and panic but i'm not convinced.",
          "hi susani really feel for you. i was just over 5 weeks and my test came back positive. the doctors seem to be saying anxiety is a problem with all of us but is it any wonder. no one is helping the people who are suffering like us and the doctors do not know what to do. when are you thinking that you will be able to go back to work. my friends and family cannot believe that i have been poorly for so long.",
          "i'm got a, sick note til end of may will see wot gp says, i really would like to get some professional advise on the breathing in the next few weeks and maybe a cat scan as were not getting answers just pills etc.",
          "do you feel as though you are improving at all susan. i am in my 6th week now and i am still very up and down. the burning in my back inbetween my shoulderblades is the worse. if i lean back it makes me light headed. im thinking maybe its inflammation of my lungs in my back. it goes easier but then comes back. i hope you improve in the next couple of weeks. i bet youre anxious about going back to work",
          "hi everyonejust had a telephone appointment with doctor as need a sick note for work. i am 7.5 weeks in from first symptoms and am feeling much better but still a bit breathless, heart a bit racey and odd pains in lungs. she said now she things am post virus and happy for me to go to hospital for chest x-ray tomorrow and blood tests - hoping the radiographer will tell me if can see anything and don't have to wait for the results until mon/tues. she did say the breathing will take a while and people are taking a long time to recover after a \"moderate\" dose of this virus - so there you go this was only moderate - unbelievable! obviously hoping chest will be clear (was anyone else told results at time of x-ray) and it is now just a case of gradually building stamina. i asked about test but she said only test if you are admitted to hospital and would expect a negative by now so will wait for the anti-body test.hope everyone improving, the only things that have helped me really are rest and keeping hydrated. wishing everyone better days x",
          "hi i got my result from xray the same day but i was in hospital in red zone and they wanted me out as quick as possible. sure yours will be clear x",

          "lulu i so agreeday 48 and last night was terrible. i am losing the will. i have been awake since 4.30 just generally feeling ill and alone. the pain in my back is now moving to the bottom of my ribs and restricting my breathing more. my husband shouted at me yesterday and told me to shake it off, i wish. appetite has gone again think ive lost nearly a stone and a half. i do hope that we all improve soon. sending good wishes to everyone who is suffering",
          "morning lulu 8 weeks today remember i've had tests done twice xrays oxygen blood liver kidney and same as viv had a bad night after a good day again my gp told me yesterday i was good to go back to work well this morning i texted my boss and told him that i am now dehydrated sinus problems still got a sore throat headache and fatigue breathing problems may be i have picked up another virus on my job swabs negative twice what would you like me to do answer if your not well stay at home till your 100 percent so christmas it is then gary",
          "morning vivi've just spoken to my doctor about my tests following my visit to a&e on tuesday. covid test has come back negative i'm 40 days in now. she went through all the bloods they took and mentioned they were really thorough. no infection detected , no sign of clots, kidney, liver all seem ok . ecg showed no sign of damage to heart, surprisingly as i know its been working overtime lately !! i mentioned that my lungs were effected as neighbours had a bonfire burning stuff and that really effected my breathing. she said my lungs suffered hypesensitivity but they would heal in time. she asked me to see how i go over weekend and give her a call nxt week. stuart , just to say when you attend a&e ask them if they can give you the full works, as if you don't ask you don't get and maybe a covid test too.",
          "vivit is so tough. just been for x-ray but didnt say anything other than will let doc know mon/tues but i did ask if they saw anything serious presumably they'd let doc know sooner and she said yes so am now praying dont hear from the doctor today!my partner is same, he just doesnt understand how ill i have been and can tell he is getting irritable and if i cough he hates it if anywhere near him but don't always know i am going to cough!! - i have also felt so alone just before lockdown my mum who i am so close to had to go into a nursing home and her dementia which was very mild deteriorated literally overnight so she doesn't really know who i am when i phone. she thinks we have just deserted her as we can't visit. it is just all so sad and she would have been so supportive of me being ill and talked me through it all and advised me - on the other hand she would have been worried sick so have spared her that. i just feel so sad about the sequence of events. one of my sons lives in la and the other in london so like most people are missing them desperately.i think on the anxiety front and heart racing it is the stress of being ill and the unknown maybe than the illness itself (just a thought?) - i had been feeling ok generally not anxious last week or so as was feeling generally better but then as soon as doc said pneumonia and chest x-ray i could feel the panic rising and couldn't sleep last night and had all sorts of pains in lungs and heart racing - maybe coincidence but feel calmer again this morning now have been to hospital. it doesn't take much to set me off though a negative comment or some bad news. on a positive note things could be much worse and so many families have suffered so much tragedy and sadness - we must take a day at a time and live in the now not worrying about what might happen. my brother just told me the r in london is down to 0.4 which is really good news as my youngest son has to go back on the tube on 1st june and am worried sick about that.hoping for good days everyone and thank you all for your support x",
          "hi garyyou definitely do not sound well enough to go to work- can you not ask the doctor to sign you off for longer - my doctor was fine signing me off for another two weeks (9 weeks in total). i think before even thinking of going to work need to have two stable weeks with no setbacks and be sleeping and eating well. if any of us go back too early could be potentially setting ourselves up for more setbacks. also need to be careful not to catch anything whilst recovering from this as our immune systems have been tested to the limits.hope you have a better day and things are looking up for you x",
          "i won't be going anywhere near work lulu till as you say i'm well and fit lucky enough there are others at my work whom are in the same situation the trouble is time is a healer as people know but also as you are experiencing some do not understand this virus and will go all negative to my needs i have learnt after now 8 weeks that it is time for me to deal with the little sugar the best way i can to try to go forward if i have a setback which we all know we will we don't want to be in this situation i have told my work again today what my symptoms are and have been informed to come back to work when well exactly what i will be doing you know lulu because you are dealing with a harder situation than myself even though i really miss my kids my ex is worried that i'm not 100 percent so i have spoken to my kids and they know this they do not understand it but as we all know there are quite a lot of people that don't i have tried to stay away from the media but i did see an article in spain i think it affects 1 in 20 people so when we finally get back to some sort of normality there no doubt will be a lot of others to tell our stories it really is a drag for us and when i do get back to normal i will probably look back and say i really do not want to catch little sugar again gary",
          "thanks stephthat all sounds quite positive so basically you have just got to heal. i have no energy today tried to go back to bed and have a sleep but no joy so backup trying to get comfortable. hope today is a good day for you x",
          "hi lului hope everything as far as the xray comes back good for you. i honestly think if they sent me for an extay i dont think i would have the energy to get there. you poor thing when you need your mom. we have just got to rest and take it as it comes. our families are all bewildered one minute we feel better next like hell. as long as eventually we can get to some sort of normality. i miss my grandchildren so much but just havent got the energy to facetime them x",
          "hi garyat least work are being understanding well they have no choice do they lol. i am in my 7th week now and the exhaustion is worse than ever. i do not feel like a very good wife, mother or grandmother but will make up for it hopefully when this does one. hope you have a good day today x",
          "oh viv,my heart goes out to you. your posts today between lulu, steph and gary have resonated with me so much.im sure everyone of us feel similar in one way or another.remember, we are in this together, as we are all having ups and downs but we must be progressing however slowly because we have avoided hospital admission.theres been numerous posters who have lifted me when ive been down, which i read again fir a boost.we will all get through this.i hope your day gets better.",

          "jimyou make a very good point when you remind us about the fact we haven't been admitted to hospital. my 12 year old daughter was admitted for 2 nights, but for observation only, as she still had symptoms after 7/8weeks. came out on wednesday and i feel buoyed and reassured that she/we are on an upward trajectory. she has managed to throw a ball about in the garden today for a few minutes and i have managed some very light pottering in the garden. she still gets breathless and has a headache and i am wheezy all the time, but in varying degrees. i do truly feel that, despite ups and downs, we are on the mend. slowly and will be over some weeks yet i think (who knows?), but very hopeful now. if it can happen for us, it can and will happen for all you lovely people. will keep you posted \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc97",
          "viv last thing on my mind is work ive explained to my boss that i'm not right i wish i was and i will not be bothering with them now i will try and stick it out till sunday night if i'm not improving by then i'm off to a and e again telling them i can't get any sense out of anyone else i've got a problem and now so have you admit me or i'm going to take it further i think 8 weeks of hell is enough for anyone and if i haven't got a virus tell me what is going on in my body so in 2 days that is enough for me i really hope you all kick little sugar gary",
          "please keep in touch gary and i hope things improve quickly for you x",
          "yes very positive results but why do i still feel like every ounce of energy has been drained from me. i feel like the walking dead !! i changed the bedsheets and it took all the energy i had just a small chore. i will like gary be taking it further if there's no improvement soon as this is soul destroying. i know it's pretty dire for everyone atm with the lockdown but it won't last forever and i don't want to feel like this when it's over or whenever the new norm happens !! jim so sorry that mine isn't a gd news story .",

          "hi jimi start off on left side then notice i can feel heart and if it is racing it freaks me out so then settle on right side with just a regular pillow - do sometimes do a stint on my front with cactus arms which feels like it opens the chest up. one thing i am convinced off after all this time a good night's sleep makes such a big difference to how you feel next day. thursday night only slept few hours and felt absolutely rubbish, exhausted and anxious all day yesterday, last night slept for 10 hours and feel so much better - not just physically but mentally. i think a lot of this illness is about keeping mentally in tact - just lately i have been less anxious but every now and again, as it did thursday when i spoke to doctor, the anxiety comes back and with that the racing heart and general feeling of doom. i think a warm drink helps before bed - obviously caffeine free, peppermint tea or hot lemon/honey. really hope you are feeling better i remember you were having such a bad time not too long ago - stay positive and write off the days which are not good and re-set yourself to start the next day with hope and positivity (i know easier said than done but it does make a difference if you can). thinking of everyone and sending positive thoughts x",

(never tested but after going through various medical tests i am left with corona virus as being the likely culprit) i thought i was going crazy because doctors and family have been telling me that i'm just experiencing normal anxiety... but as we know, this is likely not the case! ... here is a list of my recurring and weird symptoms over the past 8 weeks!: started 8 weeks ago when i woke up with severe anxiety, brain-fog, ringing in my ears, and a low-grade fever. i began to feel a cool sensation move across the tops of my legs. my skin became really itchy especially on my upper chest, neck and face. over the next few weeks my symptoms began to change and they reoccurred every 2-3 days. i started to have weird dreams, dry mouth when laying down and a general weakness when trying to walk. balance became difficult and brain-fog continued. i became dizzy and had difficulty concentrating. and anxiety, buzziness, ear ringing. and nervousness accompanied every episode. i would experience mild swelling in hands and feet as well as numbness there too. i also developed arthritis-like pain in a couple of knuckle joints. (which i've never had before) falling asleep was very difficult, staying asleep, and then waking up as well. my thoughts seemed to be louder and more pronounced then ever before. it's as if the brain is being affected somehow... then in week 5 i began to develop difficulty swallowing my own saliva. there was a notable hesitation in getting my swallowing muscles to fire. this progressed for 2 weeks and became rather bothersome and scary. but in the third week swallowing began to slowly return to normal (90% better now). so 8 weeks later i still find myself having a good day or two then a bad day or two. and it keeps repeating! i can feel really well one day then dizzy, nervous, ear ringing, anxiety, tingling hands and dry mouth the next. it would appear that this disease can have a very long lifespan and it keeps changing. it's been 8 weeks for me so far. it is appearing to slowly get better in terms of severity, but i can't really trust my recovery anymore because as soon as i develop hope it comes back again leaving me feeling defeated, unsure and scared.... wonder what the 'real' time-frame of covid-19 actually is for us extended neurological cases?anybody relate to my case? - lets comfort each other.",

          "hey jim, i do the breathing exercise when i feel i need it at the moment - if my chest is extra heavy or i can feel 'something' tickling when i breathe. i try to do it at night before sleeping too and also if i'm anxious. other times in bed or throughout the day i just try to breathe deeply without the added details. i find it helps. i generally breathe quite shallow in normal day to day life so trying to expand my lungs and get more oxygen in at the moment is probably quite important. i wouldn't worry about the details too much, do it when you feel like it or when it suits. i did see a video of some nurses demonstrating a technique called 'chest percussions' where they tap the back of someone with chest congestion repeatedly all over the upper back and lung area. it's supposed to help dislodge mucus. i don't have anyone to do it for me but maybe your wife could try for you. look it up \ud83d\ude42hope this helps you jim, let us know how the doctor chat goes. good luck with that \ud83e\udd1e",

          "hi jimi think on balance they do help so if your doc will prescribe i'd give them a go. yes think the mucus coming up has to be positive but it is the continuous feeling of wanting to clear throat and chest and not being able to which is so tiring. i am fully with you on the energy i did the hospital trip friday for x-ray and it wiped me out but partly as i didn't sleep night before. sleep is the key and when body repairs itself. we need to find ways to relax at night but easier said than done as that is when the symptoms seem at their worse. i was sleeping well again but last night has thrown me back down the rabbit hole of anxiety - i am going to get a grip tonight. i have to! it can for me be as simple as hearing something negative on the news (let's be honest not much positive news at moment) or reading something negative or even a friend trying to be helpful and telling me something negative - so need to avoid all media at the moment if possible and friends (if they are not helpful!)hope you can get the tablets.all the very best x",

          "morning to you jim. i had 5 hours too which was disappointing but managed to go back to sleep again for a couple of hours between 7 and 9. i've had good periods of sleep during these weeks and terrible periods. i had been putting the bad sleep down to lack of activity - physically and mentally, during the day but maybe its the virus. wish you could get some rest. hope it comes soon and gives you some relief.",

          "hello lulu, i'm sorry to hear that, i can understand you being worried, especially if you google stuff. it always seems to give horrible news with medical stuff. i would think this is all to do with the virus and not a previous condition as you sound like you're pretty fit to me. how long do you have to wait for the test?",
          "yes, catch 22 situation. don't apologise though jim, there's no point sugar coating reality. the forum is here to let everyone know what's happening in our lives with this damned thing. i know how you feel though, i hate to write negative stuff or keep talking about myself (there i go again!!) i hope your nose breathes easier asap. you could try googling nose unblocking techniques. there was a period where i was blocked and struggling to swallow. i was desperate so i looked online to see if there was anything i could do. i found various things like pressure points and other stuff i won't describe here. take a look. my nose did unblock, whether it was time or the techniques i don't know, maybe they are nonsense, but i hate being helpless and am willing to try anything to get out of the problem. sending you positive thoughts jim i really hope you have a better afternoon and evening.",
          "thanks stuart and sorry about your result too. we just have to be hopeful that this has been caused by virus and it will get better. think the problem is the doctors don't really know they can only comment on what they can see on x-ray. my doctor also seemed to think the lung function test was quite important to show what is going on but have to say can't see my lung function is going to be that great at the moment. when they have that result will do another x-ray in a couple more weeks to see if any improvement. i have just done quite a hilly walk and was ok - had to sit on a log for a bit but overall not too bad and my friend commented that she was more out of breath than me.anyway, have to try not to worry although it is hard am going to try and stay positive and just hope and pray time is a healer.take care."

          "hi stuart,totally agree with you not to panic, as if they were concerned you'd be going back for a further x-ray and to see a specialist straight away.when you've had a look at the exercises and percussions i'd truly appreciate them being published on here.i am sure everyone will be assisted by them however their symptoms are manifesting themselves.as you said to me the other day, chin up, which i have no doubt you will.take care.",
          "glad to hear that the nurse thinks it will clear on its own. all the best!",
          "hey jim and rufio, thanks for the words. really appreciate it.jim here are the links that i was sent. the nurse only mentioned the lying down exercise but i have done the other exercises listed too. she told me twice a day do do it:i coughed a lot afterward doing each exercise and spat out a lot of white froth. felt kind of good... i think. she didn't have any notes for the percussion exercise, so she sent me a youtube video link. i have looked online and there are lots of things about chest percussion. she said herself to check out others if i preferred. i hope these are of some use to everyone who is struggling. all the best everybody. good luck!! **moderator comment: i have removed the link(s) directing to site(s) unsuitable for inclusion in the forums. if users want this information please use the private message service to request the details.**",

          "hi stephyes will ask about palpitations too - i have a very small glass of wine with dinner have done all along it really relaxes me for an hour or so which makes me realise some of how i feel is anxiety as it comes back as soon as it wears off but nice to have a break from it!have a good day x",
          "thank you for all your help and that you are willing to ask a specialist all of our questions. i had a good four days and yesterday bought a air physio device to help with mucus, i didn't have to get it as i mentioned i didn't have any cough for four days. it made it all worse and now i have a lot of inflammation on my lungs and a lot of mucus. therefore i'd would like to kindly ask you if you could ask your specialist if forcing ourselves to coughing if maybe it makes it worse and interrupts with natural healing process, please? and maybe if there are any supplements that we can take to help our lungs?it is crazy, how long it takes to recover from it. my only symptom that i have are my lungs. thank you once again.",
          "hi macy sorry to hear that, you i'm the same. yesterday slightly better, quite dry! today woke up very mucus on lungs,breathing not so good. keeps changing constantly.if i didn't cough it up i wouldn't be a life to breathe. went to medical hub testing station yesterday doc confirms unfortunately long changeable road to recovery. im on 10 weeks feeling s**t. can i ask any of u, do u have a thyroid problem? underactive? i do n just heard there could be a link to the duration of virus . take care x",
          "thanks gary, yes i know i must have had it. the paramedics said i'd probably got it when they came when i was having breathing problems. of course everything was ok when they came, except for a slight temperature. i didn't really have much luck ringing gp and 111, they weren't sure whether i'd got it or not.just a bit concerned in case i need dental treatment, i know they probably won't see me, but having tooth problems.enjoy your day",
          "think you got that spot on jim that there is definitely a lot they have to learn i also tested negative twice and was also told basically the same thing about the swabs i went to see my kids yesterday and stayed in the garden with them for a few hours had to come back to mine had anxiety and dehydration on the way back not good but great seeing the kids obviously got the weekend to try and get a bit more sorted out so hopefully we will all get back on track gary",
          "thanks gary. i must be feeling a bit better as i'm back here on the forum. yesterday i didn't even have the energy to write which sounds a bit pathetic but i guess my mood was pretty low. i've come to accept that i will have a dip after days of improvement, it's just become part of the deal. if i can limit the dip days and have more good days i'll be happy. let's see what happens today. i hope you're feeling okay. its no surprise that work knocked you out. i'm amazed you managed to go at all. top marks for trying. get well soon gary, we'll beat this little (bleep)!!",
          "hi jimyes it's very confusing, i suppose even if you have a test you can't totally trust the results. i'll just have to hope i don't need dental treatment for the next few months.hope everyone has a good day, and thank you lulu for asking questions for us",
          "hi wendy , sorry to hear you still feel like s**t 10 weeks in. i'm nearly 7 weeks and am pleased to say i've been having more gd days than bad. i too have an underactive thyroid so thanks for passing that on. did they give you an indication of when we'll start to feel normal again ?",
          "thanks lulu, i'm hoping it's a short relapse. i'm better than yesterday but let's see how the day goes. i'll update here. sorry about your anxiety. you're right about living in the now. looking too far ahead and thinking about ifs and buts are a waste of energy but as you say, it's easier said than done. i've kind of learned to put it out of my head when i recognise it. i imagine a chattering annoying parrot on my shoulders constantly going on at me. i simply imagine i put a blanket over his head to shut him up. it's an actual anxiety management technique called 'the poison parrot'!! it works for me. try it. anyway enough of my meanderings, i wish you lots of luck and health today. all the best.",
          "hi macie, i spoke to a respiratory nurse who gave me exercises to help my breathing and to try to clear a blockage on my lung. i can't post the exercises here as the mods won't allow it, but i can pm them to you if you want. all the best.",
          "too right stuart we will beat the little sugar you gotta remain positive i tried running before i could walk won't be doing that again got an extended two weeks to try and get on top again we are and will get there you never know he may let us alone for a while \ud83d\ude02",

          "yes please, that would be awesome. i just wonder if i'm not causing more damage than bad by forcing the phlegm out if it doesn't want to go out easily. i noticed that i feel more sore and burning in my chest when i do it. it is different than any other illness therefore i'm not sure. i'm looking forward to hearing from lulu, hopefully she will have some answers.",
          "morning jimsorry to hear you only got your 5 hours sleep again.i actually slept for 9 last night!can't say i feel better for it though actually feel worse than when i had only 3.i did decide to be kind to myself last night ,i took an epsom salt bath (apparently good for insomnia) drank some fennel and mint tea and played some calming meditating music,which i fell asleep to .this could also have been a fluke but we'll see.also interested in whether we are still contagious, colleague tested positive again after 5 weeks ,she had already recovered from mild symptoms and returned to work,after result yesterday they sent her back home to isolate for 7 days again.i guess they just cant take that chance .",
          "hi macie, i find that whenever i cough for an extended period i feel sore and inflamed. i think it's pretty normal although unpleasant. i spoke to the nurse again to ask about it and she said it's normal to cough after the exercises at it loosens the mucus and coughing is the only way to get it out. but she did say to slacken off with the exercises if it leaves me too sore or hurts too much. listen to your body i suppose. you might want to wait and see what lulu comes back with or chat to a professional if you're not sure, but i will send them anyway. get well soon.",
          "would you please be so kind and send me these exercises, please?",
          "hi wendyi'm 52 and have had an underactive thyroid for 15 years. it's called hashimoto's thyroiditis and is an autoimmune condition. i thought i was getting better (approx 8 weeks i'll) but my breathing has worsened. very tight chest with weird wheeze on expiration. even going to loo makes it worse. i ranted at my gp yesterday and said i need to see the resp specialist asap. they had made a non- urgent referral 2 weeks ago, so could be waiting for weeks. i'm not prepared to do that, so complained and asked for it to be expedited. gp said hell try, but i don't have any faith it will happen. bbc news today has section on immunity and number of t cells people have. my brother has immune factors missing in his blood, so maybe next step is to enquire about being referred to immunologist. i feel very low. sorry folks.",
          "hi luluif you see this in time, could you please ask about immune system in terms of low numbers of t cells? it was on bbc news today. are you going to addenbrookes? i live near bury st edmunds and my local hospital is the west suffolk hospital, but would ask for referral to be at addies. will be very interested in what specialist says. mary x",
          "hi mary,i read the article too. very interesting and hopefully the powers that be will seize the information and sort helping not only critical patients but our cohort too.fingers crossed.jim.",
          "hi jimi can feel a battle ahead with my gp regarding being referred to immunology. gp surgeries get monies for reducing number of hospital referrals they make. feel a bit hopeless today, which isn't what anyone wants to hear i know.",
          "mary,more than likely but he who shouts loudest is heard.i would be interested in the excuse they use not to refer you.if that's the case you could always take it up with the practice manager.jim.",
          "every day mary get back on to your gp that's what they are there for they are hardly busy seeing patients so they should at least be doing something for those over the phone mine isn't much better probably why i spent so much time in a and e last nurse in there said you should really be going through your gp i said chance would be a fine thing even she laughed gary",
          "jim/garyi will shout loudly and will ask the reason for not referring me, if that is the case. take care\ud83d\udc4d",
          "i really sympathise with you mary. no words i say can do much to help but don't give up. your gp is there to help you not cause more stress. is there any one else you could speak to there for a second opinion?",
          "good luck mary! hopefully you get in there soon!as far as testing goes, i keep hearing from doctors and nurses in the usa that the test is only 70 percent accurate. i tested positive at first, then negative 3 weeks later. however a family member who recently started getting the same weird symptoms as me tested negative twice in two weeks. so weird.i am still feeling the after effects (weird chest pain on left side, but clear xray ecg and no plegm) and recovering, but hope to be back to work by next weekend. doctor says i should be good to go, but even after all of his assurances, i definitely feel the anxiety that lots of others are mentioning. it is definitely a traumatic experience that we are all going through and it is natural that it will take us a little time to get back into the swing of things. like i said before, reading all of your similar experiences has definitely helped. we can do it!",

          "i would say that you are. we are all in recovery, i guess. i know it doesn't feel like it but we have to be patient. don't stress too much and rest. i believe we will get there at the end.",
          "thank you lulu.i'm intrigued in his reply.please keep us all updated.jim.",
          "morning jimhope you had a much better night?why were you intrigued? just wondering if you could share why?thanksl x",
          "morning lulu,i'm intrigued in dominic raab's reply to your forthcoming email.last night lulu i went to sleep around 11ish, woke at ten to one and slept again between two and half past four, so five ish hours. the hood point was my nose didn't block! every cloud etc.i've been up ever since. poor in relation to being a shift worker who can sleep for 8 hours after a night shift.i have made the bed, my breakfast(first time in 51 days) and done the breathing exercises that stuart disseminated.hope your well.jim.",
          "lulu,i've just read my reply and realised i didn't answer your question. insomnia reigns!i'm wondering if his reply to you mirrors any changes in our predicament in relation to accessing medical assistance and press coverage etc.one of my many failings is failing to proof read my written words.sorry again,jim.",
          "ha! no problem jim thought you were referring to specialist's response about being in recovery! i am definitely going to highlight recovery times so he is aware how long people are needing to be off work and this should be acknowledged and announced by gov so employers are also aware will also mention about medical/mental support other than phoning gp or 111 there needs to be a support line.brilliant!! another step forward with breakfast making take a rest and maybe have another couple of small goals for rest of day? you definitely seem to be improving x",
          "lulu,thank you for the encouragement, i can't express how much it means.if the wind ever abates i'm going to do a couple of laps of the garden.if i went out at the moment with the weight loss i'd probably end up north of the boarder. jim.",
          "morning jim and lulu i had quite a good night wasn't so dehydrated in the night so maybe either the sos or the horrible drink of lemons and rock salt are finally starting to work i hope so not too much phlegm either not sure if the throat is getting better or chest and lungs don't want to push it today incase will stick with the sos today take some gargle salt water couple of paracetamol and see what happens i will have a walk round the park hope everyone has a good day gary",
          "morning gary,good news at your end then!enjoy the walk in the park.jim.",
          "morning lulu, thanks for taking this forward on behalf of all of us sufferers. i know my manager is aware of slow recovery for some with this sugar, but that doesn't mean they all are. it would be good if it were highlighted more and people don't think we're all imagining it or pulling a fast one !! with regards to 111 if you no longer have a cough or fever or the new symptom they don't treat you under covid. there should be an option for ongoing covid symptoms. hope we're all going to enjoy the bank holiday weekend as best we can.",
          "good point steph i will mention that about 111 - as no support there if you do not have the cough, fever or new symptoms. it will take a while to draft email as i don't want it to be too long and waffly - i just need to get key points across. jim, yep a couple of laps of the garden definitely in order even in the wind! will blow those cobwebs away and can tick off another goal for today!! gary, really glad you had a better night. doc told me to drink neat lemon juice right at start and it definitely cuts through phlegm and remember the specialist said yesterday that the phlegm will gradually decrease as we improve - mine is doing same - its mainly in morning now after lying down all night. i then start worrying why i haven't got any phlegm - ha ha - are we ever going to stop worrying - i am really trying but think this whole experience has traumatised me! enjoy your day everyone!lx",
          "i've found your advice very helpful lulu. thank you. i had a whole week of feeling better last week at 7.5 weeks, like stuart and then celebrated with wine for the first time in a long time last weekend and my breathlessness came back on monday. ( not bad though in comparison with several weeks ago) i guess if our lungs are still inflamed, the alcohol might inflame it further. lesson learnt! generally, i feel that i am in a lot better place than where i was though despite another set back. i can see improvements. now bang on 9 weeks today since it started. as a normally very and possibly over active person, i'm still frustrated, but i have started going out on short bike rides and very slow short jogs every few days which must show an improvement. i'm still left with the cough too and a bit of stuck mucus ( that had seemed to have gone away) seems to be lurking a little but hoping that we're all heading in the right direction.",
          "that's brilliant cat, yes think from what specialist said it will take time - i am 9 weeks on monday and also used to being hugely active and sporty so it is really tough - luckily i am a swimmer and obviously can't do that anyway at moment so not quite so painful for me. have been increasing my walking every day and do more hill walking and managing quite well. specialist also said the mucous will gradually decrease as the lungs heal.maybe if we had been told the recovery time for mild/moderate cases could be this long we wouldn't have worried so much but to be fair i really don't think anyone knew much about this virus when we got sick and i still there are quite a few people don't realise it can be this serious even without being hospitalised.here's to continued improvement and back to fitness.lx",
          "thanks lulu i went for a walk round the park come back only hot to trot because the lemon juice and rock salt felt like it may have helped i have done another one added sliced orange as well i hated the dehydration i will salt water and gargle twice a day if needed take paracetamol thanks again lulu your advice has been great walk before you can run is my motto now and i will run round that park in the near future and hopefully everyone here achieves their goals gary",
          "yes i think that you are right. it's been the fear of the unknown that's made the whole experience more stressful. i definitely do keep jinxing myself though because every time i tell someone that i'm feeling better, i go backwards again...! i must admit i have given up on the steam bowl, probably wrongly, because after weeks of doing it, it was making me focus more on being ill- the sight of the same bowl was turning me green! the mind is a powerful thing, both to our credit and to our detriment depending on how we play it. walking is very good still, both for the mind and the body but hoping that you're swimming again before too long. let's stay positive everyone and wishing everyone back to their normal selves.",
          "did my walk today but still puffy going up the hills, hope it gets easier soon",
          "i am 58 tho",
          "i'm sure it will susan. the specialist said just be aware of heart rate and if feels too high stop, rest, recover and then go again. i did a huge hill today and felt pretty good - it seems the more i walk the more phlegm i can cough up. i think maybe sitting too long is not so good as it settles on chest, the same principle as when you wake in morning and i think that is why if you sleep well sometimes feel worse as haven't moved in night and everything is settled on chest. on a bad night when have been up and down chest feels a bit easier in morning as been moving around - just my theory!!cat - i know exactly what you mean about the same bowl - there are things in this house which i now associate with being sick - certain clothes, certain foods, the electric juicer!! i also used to have a bath at night to relax but had so many panic attacks in the bath just before bed as felt sometimes i couldn't breathe properly it has totally put me off baths - it is all the associations! another few weeks and hopefully the memories will ease.take care.lx",
          "thanks lulu i will try the neat lemon juice can't be as bad as with rock salt i have had a bit of appetite come back today wish it would have come yesterday my daughter ordered a take away chinese might give the soup a miss for a while \ud83d\ude02 just heard the popping in my nose come back while i'm texting this strange had that from the start tried neil meds obviously no good gary",
          "another good sign gary if appetite is coming back! hope everyone has had a good day.lxhere we go... have sent this email to dominic raab at his personal email address. let's see what the reply is. hope you feel i conveyed our message accurately. dear dominicmy brother, xxxxx, gave me your email address, i do hope you don't mind me contacting you directly. i know xxxx mentioned to you, on a call last night, that i have been ill, at home, for the last 9 weeks with coronavirus symptoms along with thousands of other people. i was not eligible for a test at the time and by now would expect to test negative.the message from the nhs and government has been that people with a mild/moderate case of c-19 should be expected to recover in 2-3 weeks and for severe/critical cases 3-6 weeks. it seems there has been a whole group of patients who have fallen through the crack having been very ill at home, with no medical support, and taking far longer than these publicised times to recover. in desperation for support i joined a covid health forum and there are many people like me who have been unwell for many weeks. employers, having seen the nhs and government predicted recovery times, are wondering why people who have not been hospitalised, and are therefore deemed to have \u201conly\u201d had a mild/moderate case, are not well enough to return to work within the suggested timeframe. this has not been addressed in the press conferences or any mainstream media and therefore there is a lot of ignorance surrounding the \u201creal\u201d recovery time. i have resorted, after 9 weeks, to contacting a private respiratory consultant as my breathing and lungs are still causing me problems ( i am most certainly not alone still having severe symptoms after this length of time) and he has told me that he would expect me to be recovering for at least a further 6/8 weeks due to the extreme inflammation c-19 causes to the vital organs. if he is correct, my total recovery time will be around 4 months but please remember, as i was not hospitalised, this would only be classed as a mild/moderate case and, therefore, in theory, i should be back at work in 2/3 weeks. many people i am in contact with have literally not left their beds for 6 weeks. you may have seen the articles written by paul garner, professor at the liverpool school of tropical medicine, who has been ill and testifies the long and unpredictable road to recovery.additionally, this same group of people feel that they have had little support whilst suffering quite terrifying and constantly changing symptoms alone at home both in the initial stages of the illness and during recovery. gps have been prescribing precautionary antibiotics, 111 will tell you when to go to hospital if your oxygen levels drop but sadly avoiding going to hospital, with such a severe illness, does not mean that you do not require regular medical support and reassurance. gps should be checking on their patients who are ill at home with c-19 (my surgery have not checked on me once) or a designated c-19 24hr medical/mental health support line should be set up. this being a \u201cnovel\u201d coronavirus there has been huge mental anxiety amongst fellow sufferers as to their recovery and long term prognosis and many, like me, have resorted to supporting each other with online forums swapping any medical information they have managed to obtain from any source. it is imperative that we let employers know what the \u201creal\u201d recovery time is to enable people to take the time required to return to full health.finally, i would like to thank you, the government and, of course, our amazing nhs for the relentless work, care and dedication shown to control this truly horrific virus.",
          "lulu that's brilliant, you have explained it so well! thanks so much for all you have done",

          "fantastic ! thank you for being our voice x",
          "great work lulu.next step a meeting! lol..seriously though, what a long illness.i've had a great week...then suddenly today woke up and the tight chest was back, along with the neurological symptoms i felt were starring to retreat...just baffling!like i say, a really good week prior to this.i'm almost at the point of wanting to find a private respiratory doctor also. is your man based in london may i ask? i already had to go private with neurology.like you the gp has not been in touch once.after a week of feeling almost my old self again today has got me super down. given the chest pain had disappeared i have no idea why it would just pop up again over a week later. really low tonight.",
          "hi ressorry to hear that - the guy i am seeing is based in enfield north london - it was tricky to find any private hospitals as quite a lot have been taken over by nhs. also not many respiratory consultants to choose from. let me know if you want his details.i did ask my guy about the chest tightness and he said it was caused when the mucous builds up - i notice my chest is tighter first thing in morning and then improves after a good cough up in a steamy shower. he did also say the mucous will slowly decrease which mine has but as i said earlier - i worry that it is still there but building up so that is why i am still taking the anti mucous tablets to keep it \"loose\".i have a pain in my right chest area today that not felt before - been trying to ignore it as think the body has a lot of healing to do and it hasn't been too bad.have you tried the steam inhalation he recommended to move the mucous? might be worth a try. am sure it is just a blip and things will get back on track tomorrow.lx",
          "i have never had any previous heart conditions. nor neurological! this virus has done a number on me!will let you guys know how the tests go.really hoping they will all be ok and just a bit tachy from the virus.",
          "fingers crossed all will be well. yes let us know results .think it's done a number on all of us but we'll get there in the end .x",
          "hey lulu,i've been doing the steam inhalation today and been gargling with salt every night.i find with the phlegm, it looks worst colour wise in the morning only when i wake and then rest of day is pretty clear or white.my chest, funnily enough, when i've tightness gets worse as day goes on..particularly if i walk a little too much or too fast. maybe that's the inflammation.like you mornings are easier and i tend to get as much done then as i can because from 3 or 4pm on i lose energy quickly.i've been on amitriptyline for the nerve pains and migraine auras . i didn't take the medicine yesterday though as felt so much better thought i'd see if it was ok to do without but by this afternoon my head was aching in a way no ibuprofen could cure so have reluctantly taken it this evening as i can't have another night with so little sleep. last night heart was racing and didn't wake up rested atall so am hoping today is just a hiccup. was disheartening to find however that off that med for one day, all those odd symptoms were still there\ud83d\ude15 .i may well take you up on that specialist.i've personally found the private sector has been most helpful for me during this time.the covid hub were helpful to a point but felt there was only so much they could do and if o2 levels are ok then they just send you home again. i'm one of the lucky people who can afford this however. i really dread to think if i had not been able to go private. would likely still be having nightly seizures & be worried sick.are your anti mucous pills prescription only? thanks,res x",
          "sounds like you need to stick with the meds for a bit longer - if they are making things better - i've just got another prescription for the mucodyne (yep its prescription only) but got this from gp not private guy although private guy recommended to continue taking it. sounds like might help you to move the phlegm if that is causing the tightness, you could ask your gp. specialist seemed to think all the breathing/heart rate issues i talked about for me were down to inflammation and needed to heal. it's so stressful but all i can say is he didn't seem too worried about me - maybe he has been seeing much worse cases in hospital?i too am very thankful i have private medical but willing to try and help anyone else who doesn't by asking any questions on their behalf. i will be speaking to him again friday when i get the results of my ct scan/blood tests i'm having done weds.hope you get a good night - try not to worry.lx",
          "fantastic lulu, really top stuff. thanks so much for doing that. all the best to you.",
          "sorry to hear that res. same thing happened to me between weeks 6 and 7. couldn't believe it when i woke up one morning and it was back. having said that, i've had more better days since then than bad. it will pass. i hope you feel better really soon.",
          "fab email lulu. it will be interesting to know his response and hope it will be something meaningful. take caremary x",

          "hi luluwould you also please ask:how do they know we don't have active virus in us at this stage? how do they actually know that it is inflammation and not a weakened virus? sorry if you've already asked these and thank you so much for asking all of our questions. x",
          "of course i will ask no problem at all.so you're an 8 gary?!! - that's pretty good but as you say room for improvement next week!i'm going for 8 too - feeling much better this last week or so and today am going into week 9. still struggling with phlegm, coughing morning and night, tight chest and a few random chest pains but overall things improving.enjoy sunshine everyone and we mustn't overdo it (note to self!!)lx",

          "hi jim, sorry your sleep was sub-standard again,even in normal times we'd feel terrible with such deprivation. is your mind racing or is it some other thing that's preventing you? hope that's not a silly question. you're probably familiar with my recent days but as i'm now on day 65 i'll try to fill you in on what it has been like. as you know, at around week six i started to improve and had around a week of feeling pretty good - breathlessness and cough almost non existent. the only thing i had was tiredness from the slightest exertion. at end of week seven, the whole thing magically came back. started with cough and by a few hours later breathlessness and headache. like being back to the beginning again. had a week of that and feeling desperate.by the end of week eight i had my worst day, but that day i had to go to the hospital and involved physical and mental effort.from my experience, any mental /emotional stress or prolonged physical exertion will make me take a turn for the worse. so it wasn't a surprise i felt so bad. into the beginning of week nine i had a period of improvement. for five days i started to feel better. breathing was easier and cough gradually lessened. generally felt more comfortable. by thursday of last week i had a downturn. my cough and breathlessness increased and my spirits very low. two days of that to the end of week nine. but yesterday, the beginning of week ten, i felt much better. much less symptoms. hardly coughed, apart from when i did my exercises. i was even able to go for a walk with no adverse affects. i have slept 7 hours and this morning i feel..... ok. (touch wood) as you can see jim it's been up and down but there have been quite a few good days and the bad ones are getting less. i probably shouldn't tempt fate as every time i say something positive it seems to come back and bite me, but i should be allowed to be positive. we all should ! \ud83d\ude0ahope this hasn't been a long meandering bore of a read.anyway get well soon jim. i'm sure sunny days lie ahead. stuart",
          "morning stuart,the insomnia isn't the worse part of little sugar but a good snooze would be happily accepted and received.as for my mood, there's a change today in comparison to yesterday. the words of advice from all parties of whom are aware have helped no end. with regard to your point on physical and mental stress you've hit the nail on the head. i'll take you back to my grass cutting incident(2/5/20) and the carpet episode(11/5/20). both of which i surmise have been detrimental to my recovery, which i think is shown in how long it has taken me to have any improvement.we have also read numerous occasions where posters have fallen backward after exertion(me too), which is so easy to do because little sugar lulls you into a false sense of security by waking up and miraculously feeling cured.hopefully, the good days last!have a good and improving day to all.jim.ps. i've just checked the weather and it looks lovely tomorrow.",
          "hi jim,not sure if i asked before but do you know what is the cause for your trouble with sleep? is it breathing? mucus? anxiety? etc....or do you think it's a symptom of covid-19 itself?as you might have read i also have a lot of trouble sleeping. when i go to sleep each night i usually can fall asleep without too much problems (with a little melatonin or even without), but staying asleep and going back to asleep is a big problem.i see so many people are suffering from sleeping issues, but why is the media not reporting this as a symptom? nowhere online or in the news do i hear that insomnia is a symptom of covid-19.",
          "morning alllulu, i've just read another bbc article on the complexity of this disease, which got me thinking about steroids. if you think of it, could you please ask your respiratory consultant whether prednislone would be useful for reducing ongoing inflammation and if it is being prescribed for people like us? thank you. on a personal note; i felt well enough to go out yesterday with husband and kids to local nature reserve with lakes, with the intention of having a short walk. took picnic, but had to rush back to car as it poured down (not forecast!). ended up having a very 'british' picnic in the car, while looking glumly out at rain. ended up going home! \u2614\u2614",
          "morning jim i'm a couple of weeks in front of you also have had sleep problems around same time as you are at now mine i feel was a lot to do with dehydration or maybe little sugar was just reminding me he still wants to pee me off i did start to run before i could walk jim remember i went back to work big mistake so now starting to try what lulu is trying i went to the park yesterday once round was hot when came back today same again but 3 times round only a smallish park but i stopped to recover on a bench each time round now resting but ok so see how he feels tomorrow ill take him a little bit further but resting in between those days of sleep will return jim not going to be easy but you gotta kick his back side gary",
          "mkqq,i've never sleep problems even when my world has partially imploded, so i would say it's definitely virus related.i haven't been able to do anything to improve it.my problem is mucus and blocked nose, which wakes me up.lets hope it improves soon for all of us.jim.",
          "of course, have started a new list of questions for this friday and have added it - if anyone has anything else just let me know.sounds positive that you felt well enough to go out for the day!",
          "thank you so so much.... someone in this thread said that probably it takes 4 months and i think that's about right... feeling better everyday and even headaches are subsiding and i'm also drinking more water (thank you lulu). keeping positive it's very important. thank you so much everyone....",
          "morning guyshave been thinking about everyone on here a lot and what we are all going through and have been through to date. it does make me laugh how we all know how many weeks/days/hours (almost!) we are into this nightmare - doubt any of us have been this aware of anything else before in our lives! i spose what i was thinking is it is really good to swap notes but need to remember we are all different have had varying degrees of this illness albeit none of us have been hospitalised. i have a feeling i have been \"lucky\" in the sense mine has been mainly respiratory i have not had the flu symptoms or temperature which must have been awful to deal with on top of everything else. we all started from different ages, fitness levels so recovery will vary for all us but i think this forum does give us a pointer of how many weeks people are taking to recover and reassurance of the ups and downs on the way.i slept too well last night woke at 6.30 and went back to sleep till 9.30 and woke with chest feeling woolly which i now know is build up of mucous - had a 20 mins clear out in shower (eugh..). i then remembered the specialist saying to me friday when you cough engage your stomach muscles, maybe when you are bent over a sink etc., need to get the mucous out of chest - tried this and does work but is definitely a knack - engage stomach muscles, take deep breath and then cough.for me the sleep problems were definitely anxiety and also not being able to clear phlegm. since friday when this guy reassured me i am feeling far more relaxed generally - have accepted it is going to take another 6/8 weeks. i think most people have had clear chest x-rays so that is reassuring and something positive to focus on. i know not all gps will prescribe but if you can get hold of the mucodyne tablets i'd say they have definitely helped me with the phlegm.i might need propping up weds when i get the ct scan done as it is one of those they pump dye through body and the thought of it is making me nervous already - what if dye reacts with covid, what if ... what if....what if.... aagh!! btw have had one years ago and it was fine!!anyway, as usual a long ramble post (i always have too much to say!!) but we are getting better, yes we do have set backs but we are in recovery - we are recovering!! and we know our own bodies if anything changed drastically we know when to get help but surely after all this time we are beginning to see the woods through the trees hopefully with a little sun shining through.have a good day everyone.lx",

          "thanks for such a positive post, lulu. that's interesting about getting phlegm up i lean over the sink and usually loads comes up, must try to engage stomach muscles though.good luck with your ct scanjoannne x",
          "thanks jim. if mucus and blocked nose is the reason why you are having difficulties sleeping then we can say it is not a neurological problem.this is what i'm most afraid of. there are people saying trouble sleeping is because that the virus damages your vagus nerve (or something.....). this got me really worried because i was wondering if it can be fixed.a large part of my sleeping problem is due to anxiety i think. my wet cough stopped several weeks ago and these days i have a blocked/runny nose sometimes, but no phlegm, or hardly any.",
          "glad to hear you slept well last night. i would give anything for a good solid night sleep.last night was terrible for me. slept from 2300-0200 (woke up once in between), and then couldn't sleep until 0500. from 0500 i was drifting in and out of sleep until around 0800, with some vivid dreams.what i'm most afraid of is that the virus damages your nervous system which causes difficulty sleeping. i really hope this is not true and my problem is purely anxiety! my wet cough stopped weeks ago so there is no more phlegm. just a bit of blocked/runny nose these days.",
          "mkqqsleep disturbances can be caused by all sorts of things. you are clearly a and understandably anxious (like all of us) and this alone can significantly affect the amount and quality of our sleep (i know it's an obvious thing to say). in addition, lack of exercise affects it as well = a perfect storm of poor sleep. it's happened to me too. try (if you can) to accept it as a temporary state that will improve once you start to get properly better. my daughter has been referred to one of the hospital psychologists after spending 2 nights in hospital with this thing recently. i felt that they genuinely understand the emotional trauma this thing causes and realise that people need support. my daughter's sleep has been affected and the psychologist feels confident she can help her with this. her approach involves (she tells me) concentrating on managing negative thoughts and 'catastrophising' about things. i'll let you know how she gets on and any particular strategies for better sleep. take care and hope you have a better night tonight x",
          "thanks!yesterday wasn't too bad. i managed 8+ hours. woke up twice in the first hour and managed to sleep in 2-3 hour blocks after that. the weirdest thing for me was the first night that i couldn't sleep at all. this was almost 3 months ago, 2 days after the fever ended. it just suddenly happened out of nowhere! then for the next 3 days it was alternating between being able to sleep and not being able to sleep at all.at the time i was anxious if i had corona or not but i'm not sure if it was bad enough for me to not sleep the whole night.",
          "mkqq,last night was my worst night in 53 days, as i slept between 5&6am.surprisingly i don't feel tired other than the usual virus lethargy.managed to clear the majority of the mucus prior to breakfast.the suns out, no wind, so some time in the garden is in order today.i hope everyone is well and continues to improve today.jim.",
          "hi jimhope it turns out to be a good day for you regardless of the lack of sleep. funnily enough going back a few weeks in the midst of the illness i sometimes felt better when i hadn't slept well - no idea why that was but it was noticeable. as i said yesterday sleeping too long doesn't suit me either - so i guess it's somewhere in between maybe a good 6/7 hours in a stretch is ideal.enjoy the sunshine everyone - stockpile the vit d!lx",

          "thanks lulu i am very close to you i think friday just gone was roughly 9 weeks for me but i feel that they gave me antibiotics for a chest infection might have put me back a couple of days so probably around same time i've had a sore throat for a few weeks though got the phlegm as well so if my lungs are inflammed they should be only for a few days who knows what next after though chest but that may be going on now gary",
          "hi lulu,my main question if you're asking on friday would be around the coming and going of symptoms and how that relates to 'inflammation '....i can completely understand inflammation becoming milder over time and symptoms of such waning...what i always feel disconnected about and dont quite understand in terms of the inflammation argument is how i can have for i stance 6 days of a perfectly clear chest, no tightness no pain nothing, and then suddenly on day 7 have a tight chest again for 2 days before it eases once more.this is a difficult one for me because it suggests inflammation is not clearing in a linear way but is coming and going also? can inflammation work like this? on and off like that?",
          "i think sore throat is inflammation now rather than infection - same inflammation we need to clear up in the chest and lungs - if i look down my throat it is still looking red but it is no longer sore but only not sore over last few days - so who knows?!",
          "he told me when the tightness comes it is the build up of mucous - i had it this morning as slept too long but has cleared quite a bit now but happy to ask him again on friday - have made a note!",

          "hi lulumy question is similar to res, about why it comes and goes so much. i can be almost normal one day, then next day go back a few steps. is it because of something i've done, or breathed in, and does that make it all inflamed again, and does this then produce all this phlegm? i've tried to read about phlegm and understand it, but struggling with foggy brain. is it produced maybe to protect and clean chest/ lungs? i'm confused!",
          "hi joannemade a note to ask more specifically about this but seem to remember him saying that the phlegm is produced to protect the lungs and he said the phlegm will slowly decrease - which although it is still currently driving me nuts am constantly spitting into sink/tissues etc. is slowly getting less - i can tell in the morning and at night when i have a real good go at clearing it, it is reducing but it is like everything else to do with this awful illness takes a long time.all the best,lx",

          "hi lulu,have to say it is quite nauseating and seems worse at night.i think most of my anxiety was coming from worrying about how long i was off work and what some people may think reading the guidelines for recovery.hence why on a good day i think i pushed myself too hard thinking i need to shake this off and get myself moving.i gave myself a good talking to ,those that know me well know how much i love my job and the dedication i give it.i just decided to be kind to myself ,after all that i and all of us have been through we owe it to ourselves.as for the emotional side i've cried plenty too ,i am usually quite emotional though.i had to hide a lot of that from my children who are married and even my 18 year old son at home caring for me so as not to worry them further.my partner stayed at his home in hertfordshire for lockdown as he has a 14 year old daughter up there and i live kent/ greenwich borders .i know hes felt helpless and also guilty for making that decision but it was definitely the right one considering my work and its risk so i didn't want him to worry more,i only broke down once on the phone.so it's been a pretty scary experience and sometimes a very lonely one and i think we will all come out of it a little changed...for the better x",

          "so sorry dawn that sounds like a really stressful afternoon for you. so have they done the echo or is that what they've written to the gp to have done next? i do think sometimes people say stupid things i had one gp who had just diagnosed me with covid say \"good luck and god bless\" - what?? not exactly reassuring and another time i spoke to her she said \"we don't want to send you to hospital as people are being put on ventilators and not coming off .. oh and btw what is your heart rate\" well not surprisingly after telling me that it was off the scale. what a stupid thing to say to someone who is sick??!i was told by receptionist friday i would have dye pumped through me for my ct scan this afternoon and did i think i had any allergies to it - been worried about it ever since and when i asked the radiographer today when she was going to pump the dye in she looked at me as if i was mad - there was no dye and no pumping it into me! all that anxiety for nothing!my point is she shouldn't have really made that comment to you about \"not doing much else in your condition\" it was obviously going to stress you out and wasn't even as if you were going to be reassured by the consultant today you then had to go home and worry and wait on your own which is not fair. on a positive note we are being looked at by specialists now not gps and even if there is an issue it's a bit like if you broke a bone and had an x-ray it may show a break today but that doesn't mean it won't heal and get better in the near future.it's such an emotional time and i think a lot of people don't understand how sensitive we feel.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu ,pleased to hear that your scan wasn't as bad as you anticipated bless you but unnecessary anxiety we definitely don't need.i probably didn't make that too clear my error, she was actually very kind and when she said about my condition she was referring to my on going symptoms from the virus .i do understand that they can't personally discuss results with you or give advice but she just wanted to ensure that the letter to gp about ecg result and cardiologist request for an echo was received quite quickly.she even offered to take me down to the front of the hospital two floors down to make sure i was ok.recieved a lovely little clip from my 3 year old grandson ...'dr louie ' having an imaginary conversation on the phone to me while dressed up as a dr getting out all the instruments he was going to use on me to make me better \ud83d\ude02 best medicine today x",

          "yes, it seems like we will have to fight to get heard. i've just written to my gp to ask for some help. i also spoke to a gp friend of mine today who kept telling me the importance of pacing myself, do a bit then rest. i might have been overdoing things a bit (with 4 young kids it's hard not to!) so will try to watch it even when symptoms improve.my current symptoms are strong upper back pain, pains in my legs, strange pains in chest and what feels like swollen glands on the left side of my neck. a bit breathless on exertion too. a bit of a cough. gi issues but not as bad as previously. i also am very prone to pins and needles in my hands if i lean on them. back pain had been easing for a long time and it's a symptom i had most strongly in first 3 weeks of virus, it feels very strong again which is upsetting as it keeps me in bed when i've been more or less up and about the last 5 weeks.",
          "hiwhen you say back pain do you mean a back ache or pain in lungs when you breathe? i get quite a bit of pain in lungs especially right side which comes and goes.must be so tough going through this for so long and looking after 4 young children - ive hardly been able to look after myself! hope you have some good support.lx",
          "hey dane. i am 31 and otherwise healthy before this virus. i am feeling those same strange chest pains. it is like nothing i ever felt before. at first i thought i was having a heart attack, but it turned out to be this jerk of a virus. used to feel pain occasionally in my back and legs but not nearly as much. and it is not because of mucous and other fluid stuck in my lungs. after doing two ecgs and xrays, three different doctors said my heart is healthy and my lungs are clear. problem is, none of those doctors can explain the chest pain. they tell me it's likely just another one of those freakish symptoms of this virus. some knowledgable friends in the medical field tell me it may be pleurisy, or an inflammation in the lining of the lung, usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. it also apparently does not show up on xrays. they said it usually goes away by itself. problem is, i am two months in and still feel it. not as much as before, but this is really getting old.",
          "it's back pain, seems more of a muscle issue as it's worse on movement and not really worse when i cough, but can't be sure i guess. i've had a lot of muscle aches in general through the weeks, in my arms, legs. i'm having slight chest pain now which seems to be a new symptom!the kids had to keep themselves occupied today...i was in bed and my husband working (from home but still it's work)anyway hopefully things will get better for all of us.",

          "hi ,sorry to read that you are suffering again and like lulu said it must be so difficult with young children at the best of times during lock down let alone while you are ill.luckily i didn't need to fight for my ecg i just brought it up as a concern as i had an abnormal 'unconfirmed' ecg a few weeks back taken by the paramedics also i was diagnosed bradycardic last year .my gp totally agreed that i should get one.i 'm with gary and macie 100% insist that you see someone.hope you manage a comfortable night x",
          "hi danei'm 9 weeks in and am improving, but still have odd breathlessness and weird aches/odd sensations across my chest and lungs. have had joint pains as well. i wonder if this is neurological or muscular inflammation, or maybe both? like you say, gps just don't know. i did have to push my gp to refer me to a respiratory specialist 3 weeks ago, but who i haven't seen yet... mary",
          "austin,sounds almost exactly like what i've been through. i started feeling it in late march. it got milder for few weeks, then came back with a vengeance in late april. i tested positive for the virus mid april. i also had a normal blood test about a week ago. it still has not gone away and now that i've been trying to get back into normal life for a few days by walking or getting groceries, i seem to feel it more yesterday and today. yes please let me know how the echo turns out. all the best.",
          "it's so difficult to tell where the pains are coming from and seem to be so random - some days they are a lot worse than others. i meant to answer your question earlier, i have had to see a specialist privately as it was taking too long through nhs - luckily i have medical cover at work. i am speaking to specialist 2.00 friday for results of a ct scan i had today, if you have anything you'd like me to ask specifically let me know and i'll do my best to get an answer for you.lx",
          "good for you lulu that you have private cover and can get the needed help. it's very kind of you to offer to ask a question for me. i think the one question on everyone's mind is, has anyone with long-tail covid fully recovered yet? but don't think the specialist will be able to answer that",

          "dane i asked a doctor about too many xrays. he responded that ct scans are fairly common and are the equivalent of 400 xrays, so a single xray every now and then is not bad.",
          "he did say last friday that he thought most of my issues were due to inflammation of throat/lungs and he indicated he had seen people who had been severely ill and hospitalised - he said he thought i should expect another 6/8 weeks to recover - that would take me to approx 4 months and probably quite a few of us on here are following that same timeline - a bit different to the 2/3 weeks the gov/nhs quote for mild/moderate cases.",

          "morning guys and girls had a really good day yesterday different night sweats on and off awake early maybe because still got chest or lungs recovering due to the sweats will do some walking this morning may wait for the nights to improve a bit before stepping up to jogging can hear my nose still popping this morning so that still hasn't gone start week ten tomorrow hopefully you all slept well gary",

          "morning mary so glad to see you and your daughter improving and driving get you brilliant news im not surprised your daughter has been anxious it would have been awful for a 12 year old to have to go through what is a nightmare for an adult keep at it mary and let's hope we can all find a way out of this gary",

          "yes dawn if i over do it i do as well that's when i have to stop readjust normally water i was a lot worse when i had the dehydration i'm going to see if i can find something at the chemist i get the headaches as well they come and go ibuprofen but sometimes do not work so i rest up just hoping like everything else with little sugar it does one and nothing else replaces it dawn are you about 10 weeks in dawn or around gary",
          "hi gary,no i was 6 weeks yesterday so still a way to go i guess .just need to know when to stop.it still slaps me sometimes as i think i feel ok to do things and then i feel awful again.like yesterday early evening i did some dusting and cleaned my kitchen window and bang my chest felt tight breathing heavy .just going to prune the garden a little today but with lots of rests.enjoy your day x",
          "yes dawn i know what you mean i'm trying to work out how long the dry mouth will last i sorted the dehydration well i thought i had but my urine is darker than it should be i know its the virus just trying to get there enjoy your pruning and the sunshine gary x",
          "thank you adrian. yes, i have been praying every night. how long have you been going through the chest pains?",
          "my chest pain comes and goes, the longest it has stayed was about 2 days but it has been less consistent ever since i started doing the breathing exercises and going for long walks outside, dont worry rufio we\"ll be out of this soon",
          "hi lulu... just want to mention that i've had tinnitus too. for me it has been present the entire time. 10-12 weeks (not sure) seems to be a symptom not discussed as often as others. my symptoms kept changing and relapsed several times. i feel fortunate that i never had any serious lung issues, headache, phlegm, body pains, racing heart and fatigue like so many others here. but i did have repeated severe anxiety, dry mouth, weird dreams, difficulty falling asleep, short nights, dizziness, brain-fog (like you - especially in the mornings) unsteady walk, numbness and tingling in hands, warm and cold sensations in the body, (cool breeze brushing across my legs) i also developed difficulty swallowing for a couple of weeks. couldn't swallow my own saliva, but food and drink was no problem. weird. ... but the anxiety was the worst! it would come and go as if it had a life of it's own.... i'm now approaching the magical 12-week point and the disease has been a lot less relapsy, duration between attacks are at least 1 week apart now, and intensity of the attacks have lessened considerably... the tinnitus is definitely linked to the attacks. it gets louder when the attack approaches... as i said, i feel fortunate that my symptoms weren't as severe as most here on this forum, but alarming nonetheless. the not knowing coupled with anxiety as a primary symptom makes this thing very difficult to deal with. also the persistent, relapsy, and constantly changing weird symptoms frighten all of us.... hope you continue to recover well lulu. (as well as everybody else).",
          "...forgot to mention a couple more symptoms... i also experienced arthritis-like joint pains especially in the hands, and strange little pains coming and going throughout the body. a couple nights of acid heartburn, mild nausea, and mild sore throat behind the nose. but again most of my symptoms were on the lighter side, but they were definitely related to covid and would appear and disappear rather quickly.",
          "interesting about the tinnitus - i notice it mostly in the evenings when i am sitting quietly - i have also had quite a bit of popping in ears so probably all related to respiratory issues. sounds like you have had the full mix of symptoms - mine have mainly been throat and respiratory - let's all hope the magic number is 12! i am a lot better than i was but still have lung/breathing issues but get my results from ct scan and blood tests tomorrow. i am obviously worried as i know things are not right but just praying that whatever is going on is temporary and will slowly improve.glad the relapses are less intense and less frequent that is reassuring for us all.all the best,lx",
          "thanks lulu, yes, things are finally looking up. but i say that cautiously as this thing has a way of crushing our hopes of recovery through unexpected relapse. i've learned over the course of this illness never to assume that it's done with you! although, as i've said, it does seem to be improving over time. - a lot of time.about your blood tests and ct scan: when i first acquired covid-19 i went my gp for a standard blood test. and of course the results came back normal. that was about 3 weeks in... then around week 6-7 i had particularly bad night and decided to go to the dreaded er where they did a couple more blood tests, a heart test, and a ct scan. again everything came back normal. and of course the doctor began hinting to me that it was just anxiety. i had to endure a speech about \"these are stressful times, etc...\" - uhh.so it seems that in my case, and in many other cases here, the doctors just aren't finding anything wrong! which is frustrating but good news in a way. it seems to indicate that what we are experiencing is an atypical response to a virus that doesn't appear (for now) to be causing any permanent damage. the lifespan of this disease appears to be somewhere between 3-4 months judging by those on this forum, but of course the real numbers will need to be revealed in time.i think what makes this experience so difficult for many of us is that we are not used to dealing with a virus for so long. so we've set our expectation for recovery too low. i think we might benefit from expanding our concept of \"how long this should take\" to include a rough estimate of 3-4 months. maybe then we might mitigate our anxiety and stop adding to the anxiety that this disease is already creating in the body.",
          "i think you are right, because i didn't go to hospital i listened to the gov/nhs guidelines for a mild/moderate case and expected to be sick for no more 2/3 weeks - they state severe cases who have been in icu recover in six weeks!!! had we been told the truth and expected 3/4 months recovery time, with many relapses, it would saved us all a lot of anxiety. ok we would still be worried but if we were being told a long recovery period was \"normal\" it would have been reassuring. it was for this very reason that res started this thread - because couldn't understand why hadn't recovered after 4 weeks - yet alone 4 months!!"

          "hi alisoni had many nights like this around week 5/6 and think many of us on here did - i literally dreaded night time and anything could set me off but mainly my breathing problems and lung pain which was my main symptom. as it got dark i'd feel the anxiety rising - i had a couple of nights id woken and not been able to fill my lungs so was then terrified to go to sleep so it was a vicious circle - i was anxious and exhausted and no appetite, i could just feel myself getting weaker and weaker. my eldest son gave me a really firm talking to, told me to read a book the power of now - it was very positive and also distracted me and the general message was stop worrying about what might happen and listening to the negative voices in your head.. at my worst i could not concentrate on anything i just sat stressing every evening getting myself worked up. something changed for me and it coincided with beginning to see very small improvements so the anxiety subsided a little and also i became familiar with the symptoms - i think early on when you keeping getting new symptoms it makes you feel even more anxious. i also invested in an oximeter which helped i checked my oxygen levels before bed which was reassuring as they were ok, made myself a peppermint tea which helped me relax and things started to get better. i have never felt so alone in my life as during this illness and only the support of everyone on here and knowing you are understood has been my saviour.maybe do some deep breathing exercises when you feel the panic rising, live in the \"now\" don't go down the \"what if \".. path. it's amazing how powerful the mind is. wishing you the very best, try and have a peaceful night tonight x",
          "anxiety plays a huge part in this virus, from the virus itself but i think it triggers a response from ourselves. we were inundated with all the hyped up media coverage about deaths and such every day. it's lasting longer than other viruses we know and the doctors are all learning as well. no wonder we are anxious. at least we can look to each other on here for reassurance when we are struggling knowing we are not going through it on our own.",
          "i think turning point for me was around 2 weeks ago. symptoms seemed to come and go within 30 min... and started to sleep better. i think that made a difference for me. also i don't suffer from anxiety and keeping positive is important. i've",
          "hi susan,i think maybe a bit of both i'm in week 6 now and i tested positive with all symptoms , as most of us have had.i've since tested negative. i 've had short spells of anxiety but i don't feel they made my symptoms necessarily worse .even when i'm calm which is most of the time now i'm still suffering with insomnia, breathlessness,heart flutters , headaches among many others.i do agree that we are all more alert about any changes our bodies are going through though, especially bad ones and that will make us respond with a level of anxiety x",
          "you are doing well, its great to such improvement even though the anxiety is still there. night's are the hardest for me, as i think it is for others, i really needed help last night. praying for a better night tonight. sorry about your loss, the virus is the last thing you needed. thank you for replying",
          "i think turning point for me was around 2 weeks ago. although some symptoms still persisted they weren't lasting more than 30 min... like i still kept getting a sore throat but suddenly as quick as it came it went. also fatigue was getting less and less, i noticed my back ache was better even without paracetamol... my breathing is the only symptom i have now and that's only when i over do it.. like yesterday!! i'm taking multivitamins and vitamin d and i've been doing breathing exercises. i'm not an anxious person and when you're fighting this you need to be positive and believe that you are winning and kick this covid in the backside... lol \ud83d\ude01",
          "you sound like you are improving and as we all know it will take time but it's dealing with the with the i between that the hardest. i look forward to watching you all over the next few weeks as one by one you get better. thank you for replying",
          "thanks for the reply diane it's only because i have started to feel better but i know that happened to me quite a few times before i'm also quite a positive person and never used to worry much till little sugar got hold of me and also like most people on here didn't have a clue what the sugar was going on as i have nearly had two good days not night's and tomorrow is my week 10 it's like a anniversary and i'm going to use week 12 as my turning point if i'm ok i will go back to work gary",
          "haven't replied for a few weeks now.on week 12.not sure if this helps...but i can now genuinely say that these last few days i reckon i'm 95% normal now...last week was 90% and the week before that 80%.my flu like symptoms (at the end of my '3rd' attack) have not returned for the last 3 weeks.probably the last 10 days i have not had any aches/pains/burning/tightness in my lung area other than the two mile walk i did 7 days ago, it was slightly noticeable a few hours after that a smidgen of tightness and heaviness returned to that area of the body for an hour or so. i would say since the start of this week i actually feel both mentally but more importantly physically to now want to do some light physical exercise every day without fear of repercussion.i honestly dont know what to say to people still suffering, other than i'm 100% sure you will all get much better, but it takes time...and for some it will be less than mine and unfortunately for others it will be more. all i can add perhaps is that for me i sort at the height of it i did accept i was in a fight (not for life) but to get over it fully, not in an instant, but by breaking it down bit by bit, baby step by baby step and slowly but surely you will inch back to normal physical and mental well being. i may be fortunate to know i'm nearly therebut please everyone try (so easy to say) do not get to despondent, and there will come a time for that breakthrough day or moment when you suddenly realise i feel that bit better and defintely that bit stronger. i just know you all will.my heart goes to you all and i will tune in as and when hoping to hear a few similar stories as mine.",
          "thanks dilpso good to hear such positive news from you and so happy you are nearly there and yes i think this is a long haul recovery but with the baby steps you mention and plenty of rest in between we will all get there. i definitely think the positive mindset helps but as you say, in the midst of this awful illness, it is so hard to stay upbeat and is something need to constantly work on.all the best,lx",

          "thanks for your post dilp. it's really encouraging to hear about your recovery. i'm nearly 11 weeks and experiencing a setback with a new (again!) symptom of strange tightness on the chest which is worse on exertion so really trying to take it easy. it's been quite a difficult day but i'm not panicking as i have had so many symptoms come and go and hope that this will pass quick.",
          "what i still do not understand is why the media are not reporting on the long recovery times - it is as if there is a cover up and no mention of all the people struggling to recover at home - keep hearing about mild cases and hospital cases but nothing about people at home with awful symptoms taking weeks to recover and there has to be thousands of us all in the same boat but radio silence. why is this? it is totally misleading but not sure how you can get this out there. i have had no response to my email to dominic raab - still hopeful he will respond but nothing as yet.feeling angry about it all tonight - lack of guidance and support is not right. there should be covid helplines both for medical and mental health reassurance.lx",

          "sorry to hear this res. sometimes i have a few bad days and start to feel down too. what usually helps is remembering how bad i felt during the worst of this and seeing how far i have come. usually i don't think of this myself because all i can think of is here and now and my family has to remind me. even being able to walk just a short distance is a huge leap from where we were. we will get there.",
          "you will res",
          "hi resreally sorry to hear this - it must be tough especially having me in the past and now be faced with this. the exhaustion is awful ive always been super active, almost a bit hyper(!), and come 7.00 i am now completely wiped out - to the point of not being able to face cooking dinner. i also understand the feeling flat - it just sometimes gets to you - the amount of time we have felt so unwell and the long road to recovery sometimes feels will never come and i always feel friends/family just don't \"get\" how hard this illness has been both physically and mentally - why would they?? i always think about the saying \"until you have walked in my shoes\" it is so true and none of us fully understand something we have not experienced ourselves.my consultant messed up my appointment today so now rescheduled for 5.00 on weds. am not happy but his secretary explained these are unprecedented times and everyone is working in hugely stressful conditions - i did point out i was paying and expected a better service but at the end of day wasn't her fault. she told me my bloods were all perfectly fine and mumbled something about no ongoing chronic condition from ct scan but that i had to wait to speak to consultant on weds but she said nothing to worry about - not sure she was qualified to tell me that but on the other hand if it was something bad surely he would have made himself available today to speak to me? so sorry but will have to wait until 5.00 weds for answers to all the questions - we will probably have added to the list by then!my friend and i went on a walk through epping forest today and managed to get seriously lost - was walking for 2 hours and did 10,500 steps and climed equivalent of 19 flights of stairs - just what you need when you have breathing issues!anyway, bit of a frustrating day but as rufio said we need to remember how bad things were and seems mostly we are all heading in the right direction - with a few blips along the way.enjoy the weekend (sorry another long post!!)lx",
          "oh that's a shame, lulu, having to wait again for results, but at least you know they're ok.wow, that's a long walk! you're doing well with walking. i'm not doing as much now, my chest is a bit sore, and with the heat as well, i'm finding it really draining. i'm not moaning about this lovely weather though, there's plenty of benches in the park.hope you're feeling better soon, res, and everyone else is okhave a good weekend x",

          "thanks gary, won't be confident about scans until speak to the specialist but for some reasons appointment had not been booked in for today so wednesday it is.ha! i am useless with a map and a compass think i'll stick to drinking prosecco on the green in future!enjoy your evening. i've just been signed off for another two weeks - that will make 9 weeks off work in total - unbelievable and lucky for me that my employer is very understanding and concerned.lx",
          "yes stick to the prosecco on the green it is good that you have an understanding employer mine too have been good too have to wait till next week to see if i can go back and do my job if i can't then they might think i'm taking the mickey no good asking the gp she told me i was fine to go back to work like to see her do it in the same condition that's my rant over enjoy the rest of your evening too gary",
          "my swab test result returned as negative. however, i still have a feeling of tightness in my chest and difficult in sleeping. there are days where i have swollen glands near my throat causing a sore throat. i guess we will all have to wait for an antibody test and a proper consultation with a gp. even though the peak of the symptoms were a few weeks ago, the symptoms still persist.",
          "you are probably like the rest of us in that you are now post virus and recovering so would expect a negative result - how many weeks in are you? i am coming up for 10 weeks and my specialist suggested last week it could be another 6/8 weeks so around 4 months in total to recover. so much for the publicised 2/3 week recovery period. i too am still getting a sore throat after all this time.wishing you better soon.lx",
          "i know i might have asked this before but my brain sometimes forgets well quite a lot really now that my swabs were negative even though i know i'm still ill after what now is well post viral we are no longer infectious is that correct they do know now gary",
          "hi lulu,sorry to hear your appointment was rescheduled how disappointing for you.it does however sound promising but i do understand that you'll not be satisfied till you've spoken to the specialist. hope you have a good day today x",
          "hi garyi believe so i have a letter received last week from my specialist to my gp and copying me in..saying \"most likely covid-19 infection over 6 weeks ago, now recovering\". i agree with your early diagnosis (gp was the one who diagnosed it) and i consider that she is now on the mend. he also says he has told me \"to continue with normal life\" and her exercise. he said on the phone he would consider me post virus and a person is most infectious 5 days prior to symptoms and for 14 days from symptoms. that is why if you know someone infected you need to isolate for 14 days and then you are considered not infectious and can be let out again!!take care, enjoy your time with the kids.lx",
          "thanks dawn i was really psyched up for results yesterday so felt really disappointed but what is another few days in this ongoing saga! how are you getting on? seeing improvements?btw mary .. i emailed the bbc last night - highlighted our plight once again!take care,lxx",
          "hi lulu ,mixed bag yesterday but feel a bit brighter after a groggy morning .i recieved a reply from my mp a very long one actually but mostly filled with sympathy that i had caught the virus then a long paragraph about calling 111 blah blah if symptoms get worse blah blah.at the end he did say you mention about action that could be taken ..what do you suggest? i'm happy to take this further for you, blah blah.......really? use your brain you're the mp and i'm illso i sent a reply emphasising things i had already said but finished with.... we all need a lot more medical support, possibly some kind of direct helpline rather than trying to navigate the internet ,acknowledgement and for some real recovery times published. x",
          "ugh i was supposed to give it a go at work today but doctor said not to go. i was trying to be positive and figured i could tough it out, but i guess he is right. i can't be working with chest pain, especially since my job can be very physically demanding. hopefully another week of rest will show big improvement. i hope folks are having a good day.",
          "thanks lulu i just wanted to check because they are getting most things wrong with the virus maybe this country will start to work it out one day had another good day but now let's see how it pans out tonight waiting for a sweat free one enjoy yourself whatever your up to gary",
          "things can change during the day can't they? - either improve as day goes on or deteriorate - you are never quite sure which way!! but glad you are feeling brighter this afternoon.it is good that he replied and yes funnily enough we all know about 111!! sounds like you have got the point across though and i really hope he does escalate this - we need medical support and also mental health support and also feel so frustrated about the real recovery time not being mentioned - all the things you have emphasised so fingers crossed it is a step in right direction.enjoy the evening x",
          "it is frustrating but if you go back too early it will just cause a set back - i think we have all learnt that. i definitely overdid the walk yesterday 4.5 miles mostly uphill - what a stupid thing to do! i think we are all desperate to get on with our lives but there is no fast forward with this virus. hopefully another week and you will be ready for work but if it takes longer you need to take the time out to fully recover.have a good evening,lx",
          "my symptoms started from the end of march and lasted for two weeks, then a few days later the symptoms relapsed and now its been on and off since.",

          "this is so interesting mary - my partner suffers badly from hay fever and last couple of years i felt i had begun to suffer - he told me i was just jumping on the band wagon and i didn't have it (as if he knows!). well i think i posted on here a couple of weeks ago went for early evening walk in tall grass and had the worst night ever - literally couldnt stop coughing and sneezing and thought was caused by the pollen. i think it's interesting your doc's theory of acute hay fever triggered by covid - i really do. when you think about it your lungs are going to be super sensitive and inflamed after this. on the days we have spent in aldeburgh by the sea my breathing has felt much better. i think he might be onto something here and be interesting to see what happens with change of weather. hopefully this will reassure you and make you less anxious.lx",
          "hi luluyes, funnily enough i do feel less anxious. i'm going to keep a daily diary of symptoms now and will make a note of pollen counts. it'll be interesting (to me at least) to see if there is any correlation between them. will report back\ud83d\ude42",

          "that's interesting about the pollen count. i noticed the other day that my nose started to block up when i was sitting on the grass, and then seemed better when i moved away. we'll have to see what happens when the weather changes in a few days",
          "really sorry to hear this res, it is so hard to deal with and i know that feeling - i sometimes feel really angry about it all and other times really tearful but overall just sick of the whole bloody covid thing.is this for the result of the 24hr ecg on thursday? maybe this will be an opportunity to stress how unwell you are still feeling and further tests need to be carried out - you need more support.did you mention getting a second opinion privately or maybe that was someone else - is this an option?lx",
          "hi lulu, how is your chest doing? i almost do not have any phlegm recently. i just have this pain just above my solar plexus, do you have that? do you think it is the remaining phlegm? i never thought that i'm going to talk to strangers about my phlegm :) sorry about that. would be lovely if you could ask your specialist about it, please? i'm so happy reading your posts they give me hope as it looks like i'm just a little bit behind you with my recovery. when it is all over i think it would be great if all of us from this group could meet up for a glass of bubbly to celebrate and meet in person. thank you maciek",

        "sub_replies": [
          "hi jim, going through one now at 11 weeks, for me it's with a new symptom of chest tightness that stretches to my neck plus some older symptoms of breathlessness.really difficult.i'm hoping it doesn't last long, i'm basically sitting or lying down all day.i'm in my 30s with no other health conditions.i hope yours is also a short spell.",
          "dane,sorry to hear that.lets hope it's over quickly.jim.",
          "hi jimwould it be worth a trip to a&e to get checked out i know someone mentioned recently that it is not so busy in the hospitals now and they have more time to do some tests and investigate and hopefully reassure you. you shouldn't be feeling so unwell without medical support.lx",
          "agree with lulu jimplease get checked out.",
          "lulu,i have been to a&e three weeks ago and they did bloods, xray, covid test, sats, temperature and gave me fluids. only problem low sodium due to over drinking. covid test negative.my doctor re-did bloods, sats, temperature, sputum test all normal.since then been diagnosed with health anxiety.jim",
          "jim to put your mind at rest go to a and e now because now it won't be that busy and don't worry about going before that's what it's there for you i went five times gary",
          "and i went 4 times, so don't hesitate.",
          "that is really tough jim but glad you have been checked out properly. hope you are getting some professional help/treatment for the anxiety. please just know we are here for you.the mind is very powerful - i know myself how quickly i can go into a downward spiral if don't feel right, a new symptom or pain appears and equally how a bit of positive news can really pick me up. you will get better with the rest of us and we have a great support network between us all.thinking of you and sending you positive thoughts.lx",
          "yes jim, i went in to a and e yesterday, they have much more time now and can check you out properly. it's always reassuring to know that all vitals are ok...i've been in 5 times over the weeks",
          "yes jim, i'm in a&e as we speak...and finally been referred to a respiratory specialist \ud83d\ude4f .in for xray number 3 as gp wants another one done. can't wait for my bed!",
          "good new res that you have been referred to specialist at last hopefully will be able to give you some answers and reassurance.have you get a good sleep tonight.take care,lx",
          "hey jim i know what you mean. every test for me has been normal yet still feeling lousy. doc keeps saying it will go away on its own and not to worry, just need time. it is frustrating that he cannot pinpoint exactly what is wrong, but i'm sure the more normal results we have on the serious tests, the better.",
          "that's good news res hopefully all goes well and they sort you out morning everyone no change for me sweats again sore throat dry mouth has improved didn't drink as much so improvement of sorts tired but will go for a walk round the park i'm hoping lots of you had a good night gary",
          "yes, he is going to try and get me seen by the consultant who is doing the aftercare for all the admissions. it's a long shot but due to length of illness he thinks there's a chance. if not will be seen by a normal respiratory specialist . either way, further along.my xray this time wasn't as clear funnily enough, inspire of 2 clear ones. maybe i just breathed in better so they got a better image but was showing thankfully a small pleural infusion or whatever it is they call it\ud83d\ude02.",
          "morning gary and everyoneslept like a log again its as if someone has slipped sleeping tablets in my tea! actually think i'm making up for all those sleepless nights and body repairing itself. i still feel pretty exhausted despite sleeping well. funnily fist time ever woke in night dripping wet and immediately thought of you gary!! - wondered if new symptom as not experienced this before but think it was just such a warm night or rather hope it was that. it did make me sympathise with everyone who has had constant night sweats - really hope i am not one of them - don't need any new symptoms at this stage of the game!res/jim hope you have a better day today and, of course, everyone else..lx",
          "morning lulu really nice to know that when you get dripping wet you think of me \ud83d\ude02 hope you explained to your partner no seriously hope you haven't got the sweats starting i'm trying to work out a way to beat this one it wasn't so bad last night got a little sweaty i've got some oralieve for the dry mouth it's working fine so after all this time with dehydration and dry mouth finally getting somewhere not sure what's going on with the throat though i do hope everyone has a good day gary",
          "that really is good news fingers crossed you see the top guy surely these specialists must be interested in us as been unwell so long?! when my lung pain was at worst i decided it could be pleuritic pain from googling i think pleurisy is inflammation of lining of lung or chest wall - might decide to become a medical student after all this!! anyway so pleased you are now in the system properly and getting support.lx",
          "ha! it was a fleeting thought along the lines of \"blimey this is what gary has been experiencing every night poor b******d\"! have a good day.lx",
          "i agree jim go get checked",
          "morning gary ,lulu and all,made me laugh again reading those messages.going to try and get some oral spray today ,well partner is,hes been here for a few days.my appointment yesterday was for consultation with the doctor not the actual echo...i know my brain is a bit foggy at the moment but specifically asked her friday if the appointment was for the echo and she said yes but the doctor will call you first \ud83d\ude29 so i just presumed he would tell me when and where.then i got a text sunday morning saying doctors telephone consultation 2pm monday.so it's now been requested and i'll just have to wait for appointment .on the plus side finding plenty of jobs for my partner to do.ps...sorry to be personal but has anyone resumed relations \ud83d\ude02not only worried about my heart but my breathing and i think partner is petrified i'm going to pass out on him or worse \ud83d\ude48x",
          "yes i know what you mean i was only joking lulu i might have to talk to work friday they have rostered me in for sunday that goes quite quick with the little sugar my breathing is getting better but i will ask if i can find a way to do every other day or something because its still a bit tight now and again enjoy your day gary",
          "morning dawn good to see you got some help with your partner being there i'm not sure about the relations side of it i'm not with anyone my kids are with their mum i'm off to see them later if i was you just like you've got him now let him do all the work that way you don't tire yourself out lie back and think of england \ud83d\ude02 gary see told you even mary agrees",
          "hello lulu, so happy that you're sleeping better.. that was a couple of weeks ago for me and still sleeping good so far but i remember i had a couple of nights when i felt very hot and sweatybut haven't had them since. that was a turner around for me, been feeling better however felt a little tight yesterday probably its hay-fever even though i never suffered from it before. thank you everyone for your posts.... hope you all have a better day today. diane",
          "i'm praying for rain... i might even do a rain dance in the garden\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\ude02",
          "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23have a nice day x",
          "hi dawncompletely understand your concern about 'relations' (\ud83d\ude01). i'd discuss with gp in the first instance. i would think though, that you can be guided with how your breathing goes. hope it works out though; it is an important part of intimate relationships and good for cardiovascular health \ud83d\udc4d",
          "i should add that that's the serious nurse in me talking. i agree with gary: think of england!!",
          "hi mary,thanks for the vote of confidence \ud83d\ude02 x",
          "hi dawni'd say go for it - it's not like you're on a rollercoster and can't get off!! i fathom if i can climb the equivalent of 19 flights of stairs, which is what i did on the day i stupidly got lost in the forest, and survive it should stand me in good stead and besides let's be honest you can be as \"active\" as you want - there has to be some pleasures in life along with drinking prosecco! the specialist guy said to carry on with normal life - perhaps that's what he was getting at!!lx",
          "thanks diane that is reassuring. my chest has definitely been tight over last couple of days and i've never suffered hayfever before either - it is probably the c19 aggravated by hayfever. i am struggling to use spray deoderant at the moment - i literally have to stick my head out of window and then spray as if i inhale it i start gagging and coughing! with my new found medical expertise!! (aka google) i would say at the moment we have hyper sensitive lungs.enjoy your day and so pleased you also can get a good night's sleep.lx",
          "i know you were..!! amazing how quickly two weeks goes isn't it? i think you might need to ask them to un-roster you for the time being! maybe phone them today and let them know you will need to speak to your doctor friday to see if you are fit for work and it is looking quite unlikely at moment given you still have the much reported breathing issues - give them a bit of a heads up so they can make necessary plans for you not working sunday. if you do feel better by friday you can let them know but if you don't you are not under so much pressure and they will not be surprised. you can then get signed off again which is what you need to do if you still have breathing issues. don't push yourself to go back - you should go back when you have felt well for at least a whole week or more. just my opinion, for what it's worth!!lx",
          "try it and let us know lol",
          "it's like having the menopause lol",
          "my manager won't let me back until i can cope especially around the breathing, so speak to gp gary. just been for a lovely walk with dog and hubby down our local beach, but got that top back pain again after a while walking, it's a pain",
          "yes, marks out of 10 - lol!",
          "hi susanthat has been my main symptom all through this nightmare. i keep saying that when that goes and the dreaded diarhea i will know that i am on the mend. day 65 today and its not too bad but still there. can i ask everyone their advice pls. i had a test at 38 days and it came back positive. i cant get past this. my husband wants me to take another test, and i want to so that i know im safe to be around. however i am so frightened that it will set me back again. i am sure a lot of you would know how im feeling so i would really appreciate your feedback. thank you",
          "hi lulu,not sure about 19 flights for me yet maybe a slow ride up in the lift for now !\ud83d\ude02might even have a very small glass of red later \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a.enjoy your day x",
          "hi susan,\ud83d\ude02 if you see a thumbs up tomorrow alls well x",
          "the tests that they do to us in uk, smear tests, they are not very accurate and do not show if you have active infection or just are shedding dead viruses or traces of them. therefore they can be false positive. it's accuracy is only 70% and if they are don 3-5days after first symptoms. it is proven that it can take a lot of time for body to clean itself, therefore i'm not sure that you should be worried about the first result after 38 days.",
          "i just read about hypersensitive lungs and correlation with covid and it looks like doctors know already about it. please google this as i cannot place a link to the article here: (covid-19, a clinical syndrome manifesting as hypersensitivity pneumonitis)it is treatable condition and doctors can treat it with steroids. could you please be so kind and ask your specialist next time that you see him/her? i just think it is a very interesting to follow. thank you maciek",
          "can understand the worry but from what i've been told you cannot be infectious after this time (that's what my specialist told me) and if you get a positive test back it is because, as macie says, you are shedding dead virus cells and the tests are not accurate to know this and you may get a positive result. i was told most infectious 5 days before symptoms and up to 14 days after first symptoms - that is why the household is told to self isolate for 14 days if anyone has symptoms. i definitely think a lot of the testing and anti-body testing are unreliable. has your husband had it or any symptoms?lx",
          "thanks for the reply macie.i wish that i had never taken it. still not sure whether to take another one as still have symptoms.",
          "i know this feeling very well. i have symptoms as well. now in relapse myself for last three days. but to be honest, what would it change? if they are not 100% accurate? the tests accuracy is ridiculous and i question why they even bother with doing this tests? if you decide to take test again: a) if the results come positive you will feel like omg i still have it! but it doesn't mean it as they are not accurate and you can be shedding pieces of virus's rna. but you will have anxiety and your body will go to fight/flight mode and you will feel worse. b) if they come negative you will question accuracy, why do they come negative if i still have symptoms. so you will stress about everything. in my humble opinion do not worry too much just focus on recovery and accept it will take a very, very long time. there is no magic pill we can take anyway, well at least not yet ;) maciek",
          "hi luluthanks for the reply.yes he came down with symptoms 5 days before me. he never took to his bed but was poorly for about a week. he still had headaches and other funny symptoms like smelling smoke when there was nothing there, fir about 4 or 5 weeks. he thinks a lot of my symptoms are in my head caused by anxiety. he thinks i need to be more positive. i am trying",
          "can i ask how long you have been suffering for",
          "it looks like i'm on week 9.",
          "hi maciejust had a telephone consultation with a doctor from my surgery.he said the symptoms that i am describing are not classic covid symptoms and he thinks its post virus. like you he said he cannot see taking another test this late will do any good and he would expect me to make a full recovery",
          "hi viv,just read that your husband had the phantom cigarette smoke smell....me too.not found anyone else who had that.i still have it and its been about 3 weeks now,almost continuously but seems much stronger early morning and at night.don't feel so alone in that one now x",
          "that's great to hear. did you take any antibiotics? if you did, did you take any probiotics afterwards? i'm talking about proper ones, not actimel ;) they will help you with diarrhea.",
          "i did try a pack of probiotic drinks a few weeks ago but then my husband picked up actimel. the diarrhoea has been there from the start. mainly in the morning so i drink a dioralyte. i will ask him to pick me some more yakult up",
          "he still gets the smell now",
          "what happens when you take antibiotics it kills good bacteria in your gut. actimel and yacult are not real probiotics. send your husband to pharmacy and but probiotics/bacterias tablets. they are for some reason kind of pricey in the uk. please just make sure that they have names of bacteria on the box with a number, do not buy ones without any number. number means that they are from proper source not just from fermented milk. buy ones with different kinds of bacterias in them, the more the merrier. you can also get in healthy shops kefir, or in tesco on polish section. it has 4/5 different kinds of good bacterias in it. just blend it with fruit and you have lovely milk shake. this will help with your tummy. if it is caused by antibiotics and from what you say it does. it is really weird that gps don't prescribe it with antibiotics, where i'm from every doctor will recommend it, i mean probiotics. but you can have diarhea from overdosing vit c, so how much of it do you take, please?",
          "thanks maciei dont take any vitamin supplements. i try to eat fruit, banana every day occasional orange and grapes. i have not been able to stomach many vegetables over the illness and have no inclination to cook them",
          "i found on amazon: bio-kult advanced multi-strain, they look great and are not expensive. you can try, they won't harm you, but they can help. full list of bacterias is answers to questions area on amazon. as you can see they have strain numbers next to their names. they will improve your digestion.",
          "thanks maciei will look for those.i have just drove to the shop. its the first time in ten weeks. think the anxiety levels have just gone through the roof lol",
          "hi macieare they any good for stomach churning, heartburn/indigestion pains? i'm getting this a lot, especially at night lately, so not getting much sleep.i tried rennies, but i don't think they're helping. spoken to doctor today, and he's given me omeprazole. has anyone tried it?desperate for sleep at moment!",
          "they are just gut bacterias and they help to rebuild/regulate digestion. they are great to take after a course of antibiotics, it is weird, that doctors in uk don't prescribe them alongside antibiotics, as the latter kill good bacterias, that we need for digesting and defense. hard for me to tell what is a cause of your problems. maybe it is acid reflux or something else or maybe just some of of the symptoms. these bacterias won't hurt you, therefore you can try them. i know i always do after antibiotics. the ones i take are called multilac, they are available on amazon, i use them, because i know them very well from my country.",
          "ok so sounds like he was lucky and had a mild version. it is tricky as i think we and all our families are just worn out with this illness and hearing about the constant change of symptoms. i think my partner is really tired of it and i understand it impacts him but you cannot help being ill (don't get me wrong he has been supportive but it is just the length of time). for some unknown reason my sore throat is back today - it has looked red the whole 10 weeks but not been sore for about 4/5 weeks but yep today it is sore - the breathing feels easier today but hey let's throw a sore throat in the mix to spoil your day! no idea why it is but it has made me nervous as it was my very first symptom. i am all for being positive too but unless you have walked in these shoes people do not always understand how hard this illness has been and it is not always easy to be positive.take care,lx",
          "hi maciekyes it is interesting. i have appointment at 5.00 tomorrow with him and will definitely ask. he will be discussing the results of my ct scan so will, of course, report back on everything people have asked me to mention and anything else that he covers.lx",
          "you are the best, thank you. i asked my gp about referring me to a specialist and he refused. ;( good luck with your results and looking forward to news from you.",
          "thanks macie, i'll have a look, although i haven't been taking any antibioticsi think it must be acid reflux, so i'll see how i get on with these tablets",
          "good luck for tomorrow, lulu, hope all goes well for yousorry about the return of the sore throat, we never know what's going to turn up next! that's certainly proof for your specialist of the way these symptoms come and go x",
          "sorry about the sore throat lulu. i have a new symptom tonight. middle back pain. oh well tomorrow is a new day x",
          "good evening lulu just to let you know your not the only one with the sore throat again i don't know what it is and why it keeps coming back i've also got a little white dot come up on my elbow weird besides that and tight breathing not too bad a day wondering what tonight brings try and enjoy it everyone hope you got your list ready for tomorrow young lady gary",
          "ah really sorry to hear that viv - i've had plenty of back pain over the weeks - right side, left side, middle - you name it i've had it ..! i still sometimes wake with back pain on one side but seems to go off during day - maybe we just need someone to shoot us and put us out of our misery!!take care.lx",
          "we will beat it lulu. sleep well x",
          "hi maciedid your gp give you a reason for refusal to refer to specialist? mary x",
          "hi lulu, i'm coming up to week 10, have had a good 10 days, but out of the blue my sore throat has come back , feels like when i had mumps as a child. also had quite bad headaches which is a new one. just when you think youve got it sorted it takes you down again! it's pretty hard to keep getting back up but the 10 good days is something to remember and work towards.",
          "thanks julie, i started week 10 yesterday and overall much better with odd ropey days - still breathing issues but improving. i've also had a headache today and as i mentioned earlier woke last night covered in sweat which has never happened before so am now wondering if this was linked to today's sore throat or whether it is, as others have mentioned, being hyper sensitive at the moment to any irritants and could it be hay fever related? - not that i have suffered before! it is all so confusing and as you say it is tough. i start every day positive and hopeful but it is definitely wearing a bit thin! let's hope we have some rain and we may all see an improvement in symptoms.let me know how your sore throat is tomorrow.lx",
          "i hear you on the nerves!i've even began to wonder if i've somehow caught it again this last week but i think i'm just being paranoid. is just another downward slump .i occasionally wake up with a suddenly bright red throat. or, weirder still half a bright red tongue that's sore but clears up in a day.. that's happened 3 times now..absolutely random this stuff!\ud83d\ude02my breathless has been rubbish today again.can't wait to see a specialist myself. good luck tomorrow!",
          "you're not alone! me too! ... i've been smelling smoke off and on throughout my 12 week journey. at first i thought it was my neighbors but it smelled different than the smoke i've smelled before from them. so i wondered if this could be yet another weird symptom. i've now come across 3 or 4 of you that have smelled this smoke. that confirms it for me.",
          "if it's any consolation to you i got my original symptoms back just before i started to improve for real. maybe that's how it works. like a 'grand finale at the end of a fireworks display. :)",
          "morning lulu and everyone else your the same as me with the sore throat i'm not sure if that is a carry on from the inflammation or something else because mine feels like something on the end of it anyway my sweat decreased a little last night got a feeling this is going to be a drawn out one though i took ibuprofen before sleep woke up every couple of hours drinking then back to sleep it is easing i got a wierd one turn up yesterday on my elbow a white rash in a circle my dry mouth is getting better as well no new symptoms except the circle hope you all got a good night gary",
          "my thoughts exactly res i started thinking the same had caught it again!! its hardly surprising we are paranoid after all this time is it?! as ive posted before ive had the red tongue and actually have it now and red throat - only just woken but throat doesn't feel so sore - yet! there was no air in night and started feeling a bit panicky (first time in ages) as chest felt tight - it is a vicious circle for me either loads of phlegm and chest not so tight or phlegm reduces and chest is tight - i think it builds up. am getting pretty fed up with it all. i feel ok in myself just cant get chest cleared up and throat still not right.anyway roll on 5.00 hope the guy is prepared for lots of questions and hope he know the answers!hope the wait is not too long to see a specialist and you have a good day.lx",
          "that made me laugh! yep here's hoping it is the grand finale - yesterday went out came home and went in downstairs loo and said \" it smells like someone has been smoking in there?!\" only me and partner here - he looks at me as if i'm even more mad than he thought i was! didn't think about this again until i saw posts and remember it being mentioned before! its all so weird. not had that before maybe someone decided i hadn't experienced the full suite of symptoms so let's throw the stale cigarette smoke at her now!lx",
          "morning gary and everyoneyep we are definitely in this together night sweats (actually better last night) and sore throat do you think the ibruprofen help i still not tried it?trouble is every little thing we are on high alert - the circle on elbow might not be related or maybe reaction to ibruprofen? what have you decided about work sunday?lx",
          "\u200bhi joanne, just started with really bad indigestion myself, called the paramedics the second night because breastbone area was very tight and found it hard to breathe., also lots of frothy sputum.whatever i eat or drink i end up with painful trapped wind until i can manage to shift it. its another thing to worry about.my chest has always been clear and now it feels a bit tight. and i find it difficult to get sleep, usually manage about 2 hrs. wk 7 starting tomorrow.",
          "hi lulu ive decided to see how i feel friday i've been round the park a few times this week and started to feel a little better i think that i will wait till friday to see exactly i've received a letter from the hospital i laughed when they said flu like illness but could be covid that basically covers me and if i don't feel well enough to do my work i will ask to annual leave for 2 weeks again they may tell me to stay sick or annual leave it or if they can refer me to a specialist it's a big company i would love that gary",
          "sorry yes i feel the ibuprofen helps but the trouble is which symptom because it will help a headache i waited till i didn't have a headache or sore throat to try the tight chest it eases off but i went round the park a few times and it tightened up again what a palaver i was trying to get my medicine cabinet smaller gary",
          "ah ok. you shouldn't need to take annual leave but i know last time you offered they signed you off sick so maybe same again. if you work for big company hopefully they will look after you - they definitely should. whatever don't go back till confident you are better - a few good days under belt is not enough to base return to work. i am signed off till end of next week but will just phone doctor next friday and get signed off again - no way could do a full day's work at moment and my work is looking at screen all day nothing physical but still couldn't cope with the stress/pressure of work.lx",
          "and yeah actually nothing like flu like symptoms but keep telling people that! shame we were not tested at beginning it is always going to state flu like symptoms or my statement of fitness to work says suspected covid-19 - you weren't tested were you gary?",
          "no my symptoms started around 20 th march i was at work on the 8th of april and really feeling terrible so went to the hospital i think it was probably out of my system i was tested twice but the nurse did tell me that the swabs were not working properly 60 percent she said told me then go home and isolate went back to a and e 4 times after one time gave me antibiotics for a chest infection trying to finish me off gary",
          "your dates are almost identical to mine sore throat started 23 march but was ok then it really kicked off around 6 april - to be fair i had two lots of antibiotics as precautionary so maybe did same for you.l x",
          "what i tried to explain to the doctor then was i felt it had gone from the bridge of my nose to my throat that's why i had the popping noise i still get it slightly and feel like it took a long time to go to my chest or lungs but they did three xrays before my chest or lungs was infected i think can't be certain but i had the sore throat dehydration dry mouth a long time even carried on working because no one told me my supervisor told me that i had to go sick because i never had symptoms of the virus i never really had a tempature or cough only a dry one but i got a call from the virtual hospital doctor whom told me he has another 100 patients in my area whom he has to call today and has no idea what is going on with the virus and i was negative confused so was i also my mates wife was there for me she was helping me with it but after about five weeks she got a little confused as to why i was still ill at this time it was bad i was feeling like death every day and the anxiety which at the time didn't know what it was was all over the place gary",
          "hi alisonmy indigestion problems have only started the last week or so. that must have been scary, but at least paramedics have checked you. are you taking anything for it? i tried rennies but the doctor said i needed something stronger, i'll see if they work.i get the churning and rapid heartbeat when i go to bed, it usually lasts for a while, last night i managed to get some sleep afterwards. i have to sit up in bed at first, and last night i had to get up for a bit.hope you manage to get some relief from it. just another of the many symptoms we are gettingit's nearly 11weeks for me since the initial sore throat",

          "hi lulu, with all the information you have picked up over the weeks i wondered if you knew or heard of someone getting the first covid symptoms 3 weeks before main onset. i felt stiffness and slight breathlessness down left side and had slight chills 3 weeks later got it full blown down left side. i wondered at what point do we consider the start date? sorry about all the questions. good luck getting your results, think you said it was today",
          "i have asked my husband to get some rennie today. i have had mainly gi issues with a clear chest and no cough. i lost my sense of taste and smell and went off my food quite quickly just no appetite and always felt full. i have managed to push myself to eat milky porridge most days though but that's it. then i got some appetite back and unfortunately the indigestion as well, it comes up into my back and chest and i move around to walk it off, not easy. i also eat early on so that i should have the indigestion up before going to bed otherwise it can make me feel breathless around breastbone.",
          "yeah, ireally hope so.cough and chest tightness have been worse for me the last 7 days again. is super annoying!",
          "that's good dawn you will need a few days for the mouth spray to work mine is nearly there but dry at night that's due to the inflammation but i do notice the difference during the day how did the relations go did the garden move \ud83d\ude02 maybe that's why you need to relax im hoping the throat will sort itself out in time enjoy your day gary",

          "hi alisonit's a good question because there is not much out there about the slow onset of symptoms - i count my start date from the first day i was aware i had a bad sore throat 23 march and i didn't feel ill enough to phone gp until 6th april - so two weeks later and on that basis am in week 10. they do say from first symptoms - so regardless of the long lead in i'd count it from then. from what i've read some people (mild cases) seem to shake it off during that lead in period and for others like us it seems to take a grip in that period. maybe because didn't feel too ill didn't rest and carried on as normal - i was doing really long hilly walks and do feel if i had rested i would have stood a better chance - testing was not available so i assumed i just had a sore throat and not covid.naturally feeling anxious about this afternoon just hope it is good news and gives us all some reassurance - will post later.lx",

          "sounds like yours was a slow burner to start with too susan - again this is not something people are told. you have had a really rough ride, 5 weeks of not getting dressed etc. must have been awful - the only plus side about the hospital trips is that you were probably checked out more thoroughly in the early days. i have literally seen no-one face to face even appointment this afternoon is by phone. would like someone to look at throat and tongue as still red after 10 weeks!am sure we are never going to forget this awful time but hopefully as we get better the memories will fade.lx",
          "so glad all good on the boob front - bet you needed that like a hole in the head! definitely interesting about the doctor - did he say anything else interesting about c-19?lx",
          "yeah he was he was off for 4 weeks but his improved enough to go to work , i told him i feel like a 70 year old with my walking and breathing. thanks gary it's a relief.",

          "hi lulu, snap my breathing has been bad since saturday. spoke to my gp earlier and he's prescribing me an inhaler. i've never suffered from asthma or hay fever so it's annoying to know that i've got to use an inhaler now !! i know i've phlegm but nothing comes up and docs don't want to prescribe anything. hope appointment goes well. xx",
          "i had early symptoms, just did not think they were virus related. i woke up with a sore throat a few times but it always went away after 15 minutes. figured it was allergies. then came that chest pain and lightheadedness which i did not think much of at first because it was mild and did not happen often. about 2 weeks later, i went to the hospital in an ambulance for the chest pain and lightheadedness. this was in the middle of the outbreak and no doctor ever saw me. since these were not listed viral symptoms, i chalked it up to food poisoning. 3 weeks after that is when it hit me hard. increased chest pain, occasional breathlessness, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite, gi issues.",

          "i've just ordered some lipid based ibuprofen online. thought i'd beat the rush. i've been taking it on and off anyway because i've always felt 'inflamed', if you know what i mean, but i've not taking it with any consistency. perhaps i'll do my own (very unscientific) reasearch and see how it goes. it'll take a few days to arrive, so will see how the rain that's forecast over over next week or so helps with the supposed link between hay-fever and my tight chest/breathing and hoarse voice. mary x",
          "it's the rapid heartbeat i find most scary, mostly at night when i'm not doing anything! but doctor said indigestion can cause rapid heartbeat so could be that",
          "i'm similar to you, lulu, my sore throat started on 20 th march, and i carried on as normal, although i did feel quite tired. after about a week i felt better so i did some yoga, and i think i made it worse, because it went to my chest. a few days later i called the paramedics with breathing difficulties but of course, everything was ok except for a slight temperaturegood luck for later x",

          "hi mary yes i feel like they will help i've also been told to do breathing exercises as well because of all the time that we are resting up he said to take a deep breath hold it in count to five then breath and repeat a few times apparently helps the lungs ive got the voice because of my throat one good thing is the phlegm has nearly gone only get lightly in mornings gary x",

          "hi macieit's a brand called 'flarin' from 'chemist direct'. i have been taking normal ibuprofen from tesco etc in tablet form. i haven't taken it consistently so don't know if it's helped so far to be honest. i certainly don't think it has made me feel worse though. also, important to stress the fact that i think my current breathing issues have been exacerbated by very high pollen over the last few weeks. i posted about this the other day. gp has prescribed me preventer inhaler and i've been taking otc clarityn and nasal spray. i honestly think they have helped me and 12 year old daughter. my gp thinks that covid has left us hypersensitive to irritants = new hay-fever we've never had before. hoping rain over next few days will also help. so, it is difficult to know whether the ibuprofen has helped while i also have the hay-fever issue, but it has certainly not made it worse. i've also read that my hoarse voice and the dry throat i've had recently can be caused by pollen and/or the meds i'm taking for hay-fever. hope that's helpfulmary x",
          "thank you mary, i ordered some for me as well. i'm at this stage of desperation that i'll try everything. i'm already taking three different kinds of antihistamines. i have hay fever every year, but this year i'm not taking any steroids because of this virus. i just read that this year's pollen levels are the highest in 70 years. it explains a lot. where i live there was no sign of rain for a very long time. today it is a joke of rain here. but noticed my breathing is better than last few days. let's hope that ibuprofen will help, i already started with regular one until new one will arrive. thank you maciek",
          "could be 7 or 10 depending if you include the first bout 3 weeks earlier. did you have any problems eating? i lost my sense of taste and smell and couldn't manage much food for about 4 weeks, got my appetite back now but have indigestion.",

(forewarned) pour a drink and put your feet up! **disclaimer, this was a consultation with respiratory consultant based solely on my medical condition and ongoing symptoms relating to c-19 which i am choosing to share ** - sorry just feel need to put that!firstly, he said he could see \"very little residue\" in my lungs caused by covid and my lung function is 95% which he said after this illness is very good. no copd (thanks gp for scaring the cr8p out of me!) reckons lungs repair and will be between 3>6 months. he said people can function with one lung to put it in perspective. my random pain in back is due to inflammation and scarring - he could see i have a small scar low on right lung from covid which is where i am getting pain quite often. no need for steroids and wouldn't recommend for me. ok to take ibruprofen but be aware can affect stomach and can, for some people, cause asthma type symptoms so stop immediately if i notice this. alcohol - fine (for me!!). sore throat caused by inflammation still and could also be made worse by nasal drip/phlegm. may be being exacerbated by hay fever symptoms too (seems some patients are developing hay fever and asthma symptoms but anyone can develop these at any stage in life anyway so he said it is confusing ) should take over the counter anti-histamine or get a nasal spray if needed, if no improvement see gp for a prescription drug. anxiety is not a symptom of the illness but is, how you react to the other symptoms of illness, and how you deal with the anxiety - need to stay calm and positive it will get better. fatigue - it takes time just exercise and carry on with normal life as best you can and rest when needed. dehydration - blood tests will show kidney function and mine was fine so nothing to worry about - try and drink \"normal\" amounts of water it will improve. tinnitus - linked to nasal drip/phlegm will get better but also can be exacerbated by anxiety. ecg for heart - i've not had one - but he said if i am having palpitations or am worried get checked (most likely caused by anxiety) and he very much doubted anything wrong with my heart. antibody test - he said nhs are carrying out now and book on website but i can't see anything yet - still no guarantee if you have antibodies you are protected and if you are for how long - with other coronaviruses you are normally only protected for around 3 months. whilst recovering he didn't think more susceptible to other infections - just carry on with your life (he said!!). coming and going of symptoms - natural healing process, some days better than others, weather affected, sleep affected - it takes a long time but it will get better and the best part..... *drum roll*he has had it!! was in hospital for 8 days off work 10 weeks now back at work. he literally couldn't walk more than a couple of steps without fatigue and breathlessness and is still recovering and should look at 3/6 months for recovery. he had experienced everything i talked about so knew exactly what i was talking about - am obviously very sorry that he had to suffer this awful illness as he seemed such a nice guy, i would guess he was in his fifties but didn't like to ask too many questions - even though i was tempted!hope this is reassuring. he was very confident that it is just time to heal and need to be patient. he actually said if i am working from home i can go back to work - eeeek... not sure i liked that bit! am signed off until end of next week so will see how i feel then! lx",

          "glad that i could help, we've tried so many different things that, trying one more i don't think will make any harm. i also take everything that is in dr marik's covid protocol. with ibuprofen that i started three days ago i also started taking andrographis and siberian ginseng because they help with regulating cytokines that cause inflammation in my lungs, (i can send you links to proper scientific sources if you'd like). i noticed a big difference since i added ibuprofen with latter two things to all tablets from marik's that. do not want to be too optimistic, as there was a change in weather as well. i know that correlation is not causation, therefore i will keep you updated. to help with phlegm i also use nebuliser with saline and mucolitic tablets. oh and turmeric, because michael who was the first one that recovered was taking it ;) please note that i just share what i do and my experience this is not medical advice.",

          "that's good news gary, i'm pleased thought sunday was pushing it a bit. you can relax and take it slowly. i am signed off until next friday but won't be going back until the rest of my symptoms have settled down. have more pain in right lung (the one he said he could see scarring in) today for some reason - not terrible but am aware of it and throat a bit phlegmy - these things need to be better before returning to work. we have been off this long so another week or two isn't going to make too much difference to employers but it will to our recovery.lx",

          "i feel exactly the same as you maciek about my gp i never got the help either probably why i spent so much time in a and e one of them even said i was fine to go back to work didn't have a clue google is a better gp gary",

          "i feel the inflammation has just started to ease this last week or so - not so painful now to inhale and generally feeling more \"normal\" whatever that is than i have for ages. still have a problem with phlegm especially in morning and evening - just had a big coughing fit and my partner rolling his eyes - have to say coughing can be very annoying for everyone involved!! i feel much better than i did last friday that is the only way i can gauge my progress by looking back a week - that's why the weekly monday scoring works for me.i definitely think the ibruprofen will help with the inflammation - it's a shame we have all been nervous to use it before now but think from what i've read it is now fine and glad you have this in your stash!have a good evening, crack open a beer .. it is friday after all.lx",
          "i think the next couple of weeks are crucial to see which direction this heads. i am not going anywhere other than walks or a socially distanced meet on the green (with prosecco!) government obviously under pressure to open up the economy and get people back to work but the figures still don't look that good to me. think they have lost control no social distancing going on round here - was walking earlier today with friend both 2 metres apart down a narrow lane some stupid woman pulled up right next to me in big 4x4 (i had nowhere to go) wound her window down about a foot away from my face and asked for directions - what is it that people do not understand about social distancing? how hard is it? have come to conclusion that many people are both stupid and impatient - no-one wants to wait a few seconds to let you past or to grab something they need in supermarket (not that i've been but have been told this is going on). i think people think it won't happen to them. i have family members who are still implying that maybe because i have not been tested i haven't had it - unbelievable - what they don't realise as they have not had it - is this cannot be confused with any other illness in my opinion and given the timeframe; anyone else been ill for 11 weeks with a regular cold or flu before, no i don't think so - but i just let them think that it is not worth the energy trying to explain.rant over....off to relax!!! lx",

          "they are really good i take 3x1 tablet a day or 2x2 tablets a day, but never take them in the evening, i don't take them later than 5.00pm because it is a mucolitic and it will produce a lot more of mucus and it will be horrible at night, feels like drowning. disclaimer this is not a medical advice, i'm not recommending anything, just sharing my experience.",

          "hi lulu, good morning. im new to this forum but ive been reading this thread for two days as im experiencing so much if the same. im not yet familiar with the layout here, please excuse me butting in. i hope your doing better? im only on page 48 of yours and everyones communications with this thread so far!! im desperately looking for answers to alleviate things. i suspect i had the \"thing\" back in mid march, but no one can say, but i dont know what else would have caused all the same issues as youve all explained here. ive had so many horrible challenges and paramedics out and trips to barnet general. one because of a huge svt two weeks ago . im now on beta blockers and having side effect issues. i got assigned a cardiologist the next day and he was great the first week and now i cant get hold of him. hes referred me to an electrophysiologist for a catheter ablation. i dont think my body is ready for that yet, but itll be a wait anyway on the nhs. by sheer synchronistic chance i live in enfield and would really appreciate the respiratory doctors info. is that at cavell? ive been on the phone to several gp's at my practise and not one of them has been able to advise or help with my breathing issues.",
          "morning jim blimey sorry i'm always going on about how good lm getting and your having a terrible time i will say though i did start picking up about 9 weeks jim if you too ask lulu or maciek they are really good at finding what helps with the symptoms jim me i just google it hope you have a good weekend just had a look at the shaking lucazade water or breathing exercises should help it could be one of three things gary but i would check with the girls first jim",
          "hi jimgood to hear from you was wondering how you were getting on. does the internal shaking feel like vibration - if it does i definitely have this have had it for a long while and notice it at night or if lying down but haven't given it much thought - just wonder if you mean this same thing? i think for me the breathless is linked to the mucous - again woke this morning with heavy chest and taken a while to clear it but think you were going to get the anti mucous meds which help. i feel like ive been punched in ribs think from coughing getting phlegm up and plenty of random pains in chest and back - from what i've been told it is just the chest/lungs healing - some days seem better than others but overall progressing.as gary said think you will notice a difference over the next couple of weeks - it is not a case of waking up better but things slowly improve with odd set backs.keep in touch and let us know how you are getting on.lx",

          "hi graceyhappy for you to butt in any time you like and welcome! i did not start this forum (it was started by res who still posts). he did an amazing job setting this up and we do what we can to support each other and try to be as positive as we can as we have all been very unwell and anxious over the weeks but think, with support and different meds, things for most of us are beginning to slowly improve.i think we have all found that we have had little support from gps as they are mainly in the dark with this virus and are stabbing around looking for treatments and answers. we have also found you need to keep phoning gp if you are not improving and badgering them for chest x-rays, blood tests, scans etc. if, of course, anything changes and you are worried get immediate help or go to a&e plenty of us have had numerous visits over the weeks and i am told they do not seem to be too busy and will check you out thoroughly. what are your specific symptoms? if you want to share them, we can maybe be more reassuring as to which we recognise and if we have found anything specific helps with them. quite a few of us started feeling unwell in mid-march so you must be on a similar timeline - around 10/11 weeks in.i'll get the specialist's full details and message you. i did see him privately but don't see why your gp couldn't refer you on the nhs to him.anyway, we are here if you need any support, please note (as far as i am aware) none of us have any medical training/knowledge we are only passing on what we have discovered or been told - it is literally a support group where we share tips/information and support one another going through this tough illness.all the very best,lx",
          "yep i've definitely got the reverberations going on jim! - maybe milder than you - did wonder what it was but sort of ignored it - too many other things to focus on and doesn't seem to get worse for me. i've also had tinnitus - have ignored that too! just assume these will go away eventually.a quick positive story for everyone!! my cousin told me her male friend on the isle of bute became ill just before c-19 really kicked off, he had just returned from travelling, doctors treated him for copd even though he wasn't convinced as normally fit and healthy- was breathless, coughing, phlegm felt awful etc. etc. took 18 weeks - now completely better and certain it was c-19.happy saturday everyone.lx",

          "hi lulu, thank you so much for responding. i think my gp's triage and docs all sigh when i call \"its her again and again and again\"!! i just want some support, treatments , something and none coming. since possibly having the thing in march i\u2019ve had rolling panic attacks, plus increased svt\u2019s (had them years but never this bad), worsened asthma for the first time in years (put on steroid inhaler), very shallow breathing plus periodic spasms in oesophagus, or stomach or gallbladder area. i actually dont know what it is, as its hard to pinpoint, but the spasms have been between breast bones. it could be bronchospasm from asthma, but although my peak flow is a little lower, its not that bad. i\u2019ve had umpteen paramedics out in this 12 weeks and all my obs are mostly good, except tachy heart (but again had that years, but its definitely been made worse). i had a lung x-ray a few weeks ago at barnet general and that was clear. one svt though landed me in resuscitation a couple of weeks ago and i\u2019ve now been officially diagnosed with paroxysmal svt (now on a list for catheter ablation and waiting to hear from an electrophysiologist) . in all these weeks since mid march i keep waking from sleep with hyperventilation. it\u2019s driving me nuts. for weeks its actually made me terrified to sleep and i\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re nocturnal panic attacks or sleep apnea even?? my oxygen in these episodes is 99%, (which does point to hyperventilation syndrome?). the new beta blockers get my high hr down fairly quickly (although they in themselves are giving me hella side effects).this shallow breathing is giving me so many symptoms and it\u2019s exhausting : im giddy, my fingers tingle, my back hurts, my stomach hurts, i have an intense internal tremor and i feel like i'm on ship in storm. im also super uber sensitive to smells and vapours, they make me cough. my nose is sore and dry and yet i feel all phlegmy in my throat and have to keep swallowing. if i eat i feel like im suffocating a bit (& i hate writing that, its so frightening). the back of my throat feel sore and burns a bit, so do my ears. ive had really bad gastritis, which is odd as my acid was being controlled well with lanzoprozole for years and then bam mid march i was in ridic burning pain in my stomach and upwards. my body all over seems hyper hyper sensitive to so much. the gp's have tried various benzos and antidepressants in these weeks to calm me down and my body has reacted violently to them. the diazepam was horrific, as with an already slowed breath and respiration system it only made for a horror filled night when i tried them to get better sleep!! mirtazapene landed me in a&e with my throat closing! i paid for one session of hypnotherapy to see if that could calm my fight or flight (& bring on rest and digest more) and can\u2019t pay for much more but without a few sessions i\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll help retrain my system a bit. he reckons he can help though. if i try and deep breath my hr rockets and i cough. so doing meditation and mindfulness is really hard (i have cptsd from decades of mental and emotional abuse from various key relationships and marriage plus medical ptsd from some horrible horrible medical experiences over the years). to say i'm sensitive in all ways is an understatement right now. i have to stay off social media and news a lot or it triggers such anxiety and worry. folks love to regale in absolute horror stories. any bit of stress and my body cant cope. with all this my abusive ex husband to be is also pushing and pushing to keep doing admin for divorce and deny that i'm really not well at all and angry that i cant do things he's requesting. its really adding to the load on my body and soul. i feel like i\u2019m not properly in my body and it\u2019s quite distressing, but im a fighter and im looking for resources, and support and treatments to get better. i need to get better. im a single mum alone with two teens who have needs and i need to be stronger physically (although i was already partially disabled by cns disorder/fibromyalgia and m.e before this). i know this is long, theres just been so much. thank you for reading if you havegracey x",
          "oh and ive also had chills and nerve pain in my digits and body, but that may be the beta blockers as its known to cause that. the only time i had a slight low grade fever (37.7) was in march for a few days. id already had a gerd cough, but it did seem more apparent in these weeks. at the worst part i was coughing and being sick with phlegm. they put me on cyclizine for while, but i'm wondering if my body actually just wanted to expel.",

          "hi graceysounds like a really tough time for you. i'll list all the things i can think of that we have experienced between us over last few weeks and which we feel are related to c-19 and then you may feel a bit more reassured that you are not alone - these symptoms come and go for most of us and some days worse than others. the anxiety, for me, has decreased as i am getting better but still bubbles below the surface and i have never been an anxious person so for you already suffering from panic attacks it must feel so much worse but perhaps you have been taught better managing techniques that some of us. also underlying fibromyalgia and me are going to exacerbate the fatigue we have all felt. anyway, here goes....* anxiety - we have all suffered badly with this. for me it made everything so much worse so had to find a way to calm down. i do yoga so check out basic positions (find quiet room, lay on floor, arms, legs out, eyes shut and breathe slowly) focus on breathing and nothing else. have a look on youtube basic yoga breathing.* sleeplessness - we have all suffered badly with this but for some now improving. peppermint tea has helped me calm down at night but it is hard.* coughing - some of us have suffered - i have especially mornings and night and a constant trying to clear throat or phlegm. in early days felt like ball of phlegm at back of throat. now phlegm in throat and on chest and can't always cough up. some of us are on anti-mucous meds.* red/sore throat a few of us have had this and i still do intermittently.* breathing issues/breathlessness - most of us have suffered and still suffering with this. some days better/worse than others.* gastric issues/diahorrea - quite a few have suffered with this. i had this early only on but has improved but not quite right yet - could be the meds ive been taking.* media/news quite a few of us have not been following news was too distressing. i personally deleted all news apps from phone and am careful what i read/watch.* fatigue - we have all felt this, exhausted from doing not much but again this improves over time. the specialist i'm seeing had c19 and told me he literally could only take two steps when he first started recovering. he is now back at work.* chills - many people have had this but i haven't.* fever/night sweats - some people have struggled with this and still are. i never had a temperature.* diet - try and eat as healthy as you can, plenty of vit c (squeeze a fresh orange and lemon each day), vit d supplement, iron (bags of spinach are cheap and you can wilt into pretty much any meal). i really hope this helps reassure you and if anyone else in our group can add anything to help i'm sure they will. sounds like your oxygen level is good so that must be reassuring - something positive to focus on. lx",

          "hi garry,that's great news. i use them i think fourth day alongside ibuprofen (still waiting for my delivery of lipid one so i started with regular one). so far i noticed massive difference. much less mucus. i also found really interesting article today in guardian titled: i\u2019ve been ill for months, but i still don't know if it is covid-19the author has same story like most of us. but there is a very important thing that he mentions. that removing mucus from lungs is very, very important. because it can dry there and block alveoli in lungs and they die. he also mentioned percussion massage. i didn't mention it before but my wife does it to me from very beginning of my sickness. there is an awesome video on youtube called: postural drainage, percussion, vibration technique. by physio keeps you moving we do this at least twice a day after nebulisation with saline. if you don't have that then use steam inhalation with water and salt for 10min. it makes massive difference with coughing out this phlegm. they are just tips for anyone who is reading this and struggle with stuck and blocked lungs. what really surprised me is that doctors don't mention this to us.",

          "had trouble getting to sleep but took the two together so that might not be a good idea for me woke up in the middle of the night randy that must have been the siberian no bloody good to me was up early round the park a few times and still feeling okay just got tingling in my hands that comes and goes chest is ok i have to sleep on my side now though let's hope everyone has a good day going to try something different today not going to rest till late weeks ago used to knock me for six in the afternoon now going to try to not to settle too early try and push till night time hopefully little sugar plays the game gary",
          "afternoon gary, lulu and everyone. gary i've had side effects from certain vits or meds if i've introduced them newly, maybe google possible side effects. just to say my breathing hasn't been too bad last few days. but i've had a painful left arm and think it's from the glands under my armpit the lymph nodes. has anyone else had this ? i had this early on and gp said this was connected to an infection so prescribed me antibiotics. also have soreish throat and the funny tongue thing is back lulu!! it's never ending !!",
          "afternoon gary and everyone,you are funny gary at least it's working even though you may not be able to put it to use \ud83d\ude02going to try and be a bit more active today even though i'm still only getting about 5 hours sleep and couldn't lay on my left side at all last night ,felt like a stitch in my lung.only one hot sweat last night though.chest a bit tight this morning but breathing seems a little better,i'll see how i feel after a walk out though it scares me how quick it can change with a little exertion.have a good day all x",
          "hi steph,my arms and upper body ached terrible last week,even lifting the kettle and opening the fridge were painful,my right arm still aches when lifting it which i presume was from a little bit of pruning i done, no swollen glands though x",
          "thank you for the update gary.keep me in the loop how they're going as it'll be the end of the week before mine arrive.jim.",
          "thanks for letting me know dawn. it just feels like the beginning of a cold or flu achey, with sore throat but we all know it's this little \"sugar\" i've had the really sensitive back too probs where my lungs are but that feels a bit better now as i'm able to lean on it for longer periods. lulu thanks for letting us know about someone you know recovering after 18 weeks it gives us hope that one day we will hopefully get there too xx",
          "yes i know what you mean steph about the side effects i think now i will just take one and then a couple of hours take another still should do the same just stretch it out and hopefully no side effects my hands have been tingling since this morning have a good day gary",
          "afternoon dawn you are improving the sweats what about dry mouth i think that comes with the inflammation because mine is better but still dry at night yes it's so hard to get this right i know rest is good but i feel we have to try and see how far to push gotta sort this tingling enjoy the rest of your day dawn hopefully the sweats will do one soon gary",
          "ok jim will do i hope you're having a better day gary",
          "afternoon lulu and all, hope your all having a better day? do moderated comments ever get posted? i don't remember reading about the person who recovered after 18 wks, is it quite far back? id love to read and build some hope! feeling anxious today after a rough rough night (shared about it replying to gail28154 on page 62 ). is it me or it is hard to find current comments as they get slotted in pages further back!?. i remember taking 3 months to recover from flu 2017-2018. so i figure this will take quite a bit longer with my underlying issues.",
          "hi stephi've had a sore left arm/shoulder on and off for the past week. it sounds similar to you, i can feel it under my arm too, and sometimes my chest. the doctor didn't know what it was.i'm finding my heat pack seems to sooth it for a bit. seems just another symptom! hope you can get some relief soon",
          "hi gary,dry mouth improving but i think its how i'm breathing that makes it worse at night.i remember in the beginning when i was breathing really bad i had constant dry mouth literally immediately after drinking and continuous thirst so its improved greatly.just got back from a 15 slow walk,felt like i was spaced out and my eyes felt heavy ,came in and quite shakey ,breathing heavier but soon settled after sitting for a bit..having a cuppa before starting on some cleaning.i'm going for it today .is the tingling constant or just when you're walking ?i only got the tingling when i was tachycardic x",
          "hi grace, you can find lulu's message about 18 week recovery on a message to jim posted 1 day ago. i know what you mean about messages all over the place !! thanks for reply joanne about a similar pain in left arm. i can't see a swelling under arm it just feels tender. gosh if gp doesn't know what it is what hope have we got!! think any medical knowledge they had before this is all gone !! i know it's a new virus but they should know more than us shouldn't they ???",
          "hi graceyno idea why earlier post was moderated and no idea what happens after that! there were no sweary words or links so baffles me. anyway i'll try and reply again if i can remember what i said!extreme anxiety - we have all had this and as we have progressed for most of us think it has improved. it is obviously harder for you as you suffer panic attacks but maybe you are better equipped to deal with the anxiety than we were - you must know some breathing techniques and maybe other techniques you could share with us!breathing - we have all suffered problems with breathing, tight chest, sore throat - i find moving helps, shorts walks and build up to more. the more i sit around the worst it is for me but you need to take it slowly. gary reckons ibruprofen helps with tight chest i believe but i haven't tried. i think ibruprofen will also help with throat. i also cough if i deep breath.oxygen levels - yours sound as if good but can buy an oximeter if you don't have one from amazon and check which is reassuring.back pains/chest pains - most of us have suffered with these - i was told by specialist for me that this is the inflammation/lesions in lungs and will improve - some days worse than others and some days one lung worse and not other and vice versa. also random chest pains which come and go.internal tremors - jim and i talked about this yesterday - i definitely have this and noticed it last night but just ignore it - no idea what it is but hasn't got better or worse and doesn't bother me too much. jim might be able to help more with this.smell/vapours - not had too much of a problem with this but can't put deodorant on without hanging head out of window! couple of people have randomly smelt cigarette smoke so you are definitely not alone. remember lungs will be super sensitive so avoid anything which will irritate lungs as far as possible.phlegm - have had a huge problems with this and it is better but still there - when first ill felt like i had a huge ball of phlegm at back of throat - hot showers help me cough it up and also take mucodyne. many others have phlegm problems so again you are not alone. sore throat - was my first symptom and still comes and goes. throat still looks red but not so painful now believe it is inflammation - gary has same problem and as i said above think ibruprofen will help.heart rate - think most of us have had racing heart rates - i certainly have but it has settled down now - think partly caused by anxiety and also the virus but if mine felt too fast i would just rest until it settled down and then start again but obviously if you have any heart issues need to be more aware. i kept a note of my heart rate/blood pressure and oxygen levels each days and after a couple of weeks or so saw some improvement. i would check my heart rate after going upstairs on my watch and sometimes was sky high but now improved.fatigue - we have all had this and the only thing is to rest between any chores and listen to your body - i spent ages doing nothing - chatting on here!!sleep - all had sleep problems and some people still are - mine was at height of illness and i believe mainly caused by anxiety as that improved my sleep also did. others may be able to add more to this and i believe some are taking meds.sorry if any of this sounds obvious just wanted you to know you are not alone with your symptoms and i think most of us would agree we are all improving but maybe not until week 8/9. my specialist told me initially 4 months to recover and then on friday said for my lungs to recover fully could take 6/12 months. he did tell me though will recover and i believe other people have been told same. you have to believe that. i am going into week 11 tomorrow.none of us have any medical training (as far as i know!!) just sharing tips and treatments which have helped us through and i'm sure the others may be able to add more as we have all had similar symptoms but some worse than others.take care, stay strong and positive and try and find a coping mechanism for the anxiety, if you can it will help you so much, (i know easier said than done) but try not to be too scared and if anything changes get medical help. sounds like you are on the same timeframe as me so hopefully you will be feeling better soon. all the best,lx",
          "i've had this symptom from the start.is super weird. doctors have no clue\ud83d\ude02 i personally think it may be inflammation from some lymph nodes as it goes up and down a bit a d slightly reminds me of when i had bad m.e and got raised glands on and off in my neck for no apparent reason. odd one though!",
          "week 11 for me too tomorrow!chest still tight as a drum but i think some of that is post rain pollen.on another set of antibiotics and hating every second as body is responding very sensitively to any medication. i also dont think i need it but i think the doctor wants to ( again) rule out secondary infection. it hasn't improved the cough or chest atall though and am already day 4 on them. they r making me sick as a parrot.glad you found us gracey!",
          "no dawn the tingling is really weird coming and going i had few weeks back but my legs were as well then but not now itll probably do one soon your going for it today as well then i'm off out again trying to not settle too early today we both might pay for it later hopefully not enjoy gary",
          "hi steph, finally found the comment to jim (i checked my emails). its made me think that i should really see if i can get hold of the respiratory doctor lulu mentioned. such a small world that he's at a hospital literally down the road from where i live! what with that and getting an ultrasound on my stomach and abdomen this coming tuesday , i'll may be get some more answers as to some of the strangeness i'm experiencing. i was directed to a new websites via an asthma nurse (at asthma uk) created by lister hospital think? which was created for those recovering at home after admission. there's a few copd breathing techniques videos on there. ive tried them but they hurt and make me hyperventilate and i need to know why. i cant link it here can i ? if anyone would like it may be message me? i agree, it feels like none of the gp's have been versed in knowing what all this is and he funkiness of it all.",
          "urghh i hear you on the antibiotics , they make me so unwell and i react badly to them anyway, but right now i cant face them. my gp tried to put me on clarythromicin part way through and my body said nope at the 1st one. i'm allergic to erythromycin already sooooo.....there is a probiotic you can take that will survive the antibiotic, but you have to be careful if unwell. id say get some strong good ones ready for the day after you finished and chug them! vsl#3 is used often for those of us with bowel disease. it comes in packs of 10 or 20 sachets for the fridge and is a good medicinal dose. gotta repopulate that good bacteria quick. i do hope you start feeling a bit better, it can take until a few days after the course to feel better sometimes (if it is an infection anyway). its all so hard to endure day after day and be stuck at home (mind you i'm not allowed to drive now i have unstable svt's) and have to wait 4 weeks on this horror blocker drug before i can - but i'm to wobbly anyway to do so, so there's that.",
          "unbelievable isn't it res- i had two lots of antibiotics as precautionary and not sure i needed them but i spose better safe than sorry but then if no secondary infection they are not going to improve anything - everything else has to heal and get better in its own time. no two days are same. yesterday i had tight chest all day and back pain today that is better but have sore throat!! did go for a walk around st catherine's dock and i wore a face mask (made me feel much safer as was busy) but was aware that i was inhaling my own breath so think that affected throat but was good to go out and be \"normal\" for a couple of hours.lx",
          "hi res, i just wrote you reply, i think it got moderated as i mentioned some probiotic type!",
          "think to keep the trail going we need to hit \"reply\" to someone's specific message as opposed to the big blue \"post reply\" button at bottom of page! gary pointed out i had done this the other day and he couldn't find me! not sure it matters who's message you reply to as think we probably all scroll through and read but it does keep it on one page and puts the latest comment at the bottom - i think!lx",
          "hi gary ,yes that is a weird one but so many of them.go you ,let's hope not x",
          "hi lulu,hope the back pain and sore throat ease a little later.nice for you to get out though,i find i breathe much heavier with mask too but would rather wear one .hope that improves by the time i go back to work i will be wearing one for 12 hours . i get so anxious about people coming so close even in my little local co op when popped out ,people are so impatient and careless.have a nice evening x",

          "i did/do for the most part, there's been the odd comment i've just posted. i'll make sure i reply to someone to keep it in the flow.",
          "thank you for such a detailed response, ( this and your moderated one showed up now). i need to wade in more to both , just having a tricky afternoon which feels like a ground hog day of yesterday! did the cat scan show some issues then? i'm sorry if they did, but he believes you can recover still, just slow and steady right? you're already doing a lot better by being able to go into the west end. i cant even leave my house fort a walk (i was before the big svt happened and the bloody beta blockers). do you live near enfield? funny if your'e not far from me! i'm calling insurance tomorrow about seeing that doc as he's like a walk away from my house (if i can walk there ooooofff - i'm right by chase farm hospital)!",
          "oh dear! they do that sometimes \ud83e\udd26\u200d",
          "hi graceyhe was pretty happy with the ct scan said lungs only functioning 95% but that is fine (apparently!!) told me you can survive with one lung (puts it into perspective) and a couple of scars on lungs - more on right lung which i can feel as i have pain in that area - he was very upbeat and said nothing to worry about it will all heal and get better but may take up to a year in total but reckons i should be feeling better in 4 months-ish. i'm in loughton and work in london but my local private hospital had been taken over by nhs so had to schlep over to enfield - only took 20 mins so was fine. i liked him a lot - i was a nervous wreck before the first consultation and he was very reassuring (maybe because he has had it?) - had the first decent nights sleep for weeks after i had spoken to him! take it slowly, try and stay positive and maybe set one goal each day and am pretty sure things will improve soon but also be realistic that from what we have all experienced this does not get better overnight - i think that is where i went wrong i kept thinking i'd wake up better but had someone told me it would be up and down and good days/bad days for this amount of time i would've been better prepared and less anxious. hope this helps.lx",
          "i do it all the time, so wouldn't worry too much - we normally get back on track and find the messages! feel sorry for anyone who has just found this thread and wading through all these messages! on the plus side there must be loads of info on here by now. if you see a long message you know it is me (i have a tendency to talk/type a lot!!) just got too much to say for myself!lx",
          "hi dawnyep tricky isn't it my sunglasses kept steaming up!! i was thinking that when walking around that everyone has a difference experience - some people don't seem to care at all about social distancing others are super nervous - you don't know people's circumstances - either you may have experienced the virus yourself or had a family member really ill or even worse lost someone so you are bound to feel nervous - i am darting around all over the place avoiding people but that is because of my experience. maybe we are safer than others who haven't had it if we have antibodies - let's hope so.take care, hope you are getting on ok. partner not visiting this weekend?!lx",
          "hi lulu,hadn't thought about the glasses aspect,i only need to wear mine for tv, driving,but not so sure anymore as they seem to have deteriorated ,eye test on the agenda,not worn the sunglasses with the mask yet.hes over tuesday,trying to be sensible and leave a 7 day gap where he only has his daughter at his home, not strictly lockdown rules i know and it does make me feel like i'm doing something wrong (i asked my eldest not to arrest him) but i think our mental health was more important taking into account the stress we were both feeling while i was so ill.i'm hoping that we have built some immunity but still very cautious, i'm actually a zoflora queen and still antibac everything !\ud83d\ude02 x",
          "guys,as you know i've had my up's and downs with this tripe. yes, i've definitely had more downs than up but there has been an improvement looking back over the weeks.i'm now on week 9 and early this afternoon suddenly felt washed out, sick and started shaking uncontrollably again. throats closing, my nose is blocked and i've got a rash across my nose and face.all bar the feeling sick reminded me of the first two or three weeks. i couldn't eat even if i tried. i even fell asleep this afternoon.my sats are okay.anyone else had a relapse like this so far on?jim.",
          "i look like i'm going icognito - face mask, sunglasses, gloves ... lol! no-one would recognise me!ah good that is something to look forward to and sounds like you are doing it sensibly - it is so tough at the moment and you had added stress of being ill and not being together and hopefully takes your mind off things for a couple of days.yep if you stand still long enough around here you get wiped down with a dettol wipe - takes me about 2 hours to unpack shopping as have to wipe it all down! not sure can do for too much longer. are you or anyone else getting takeaways?lx",
          "hi jimsounds really tough - have you done anything different today, taken any different meds, eaten anything different? sounds like could be an allergy with the rash. just wanted to say really sorry you've had such a bad afternoon. i definitely think it is only when you look back you can see the improvement - am sure it is a blip and things will be better tomorrow - it does seem to be up and down all the time.take care,lx",
          "yes ive had quite a few takeaways just to try and get some normality back in my life. ive just also had a few glasses of wine with my tea. bet im back to square one in the morning!! ( or have a bad night tonight) im just having a day today where ive had enough of being ill ! ive just had a big rant about everything that i think is wrong with the world. i also went to decathalon as i needed to get out ( had my face mask on and gloves mind !!)",
          "thanks lulu.i wish i had an answer be it meds food etc, as it be understandable, however it's just been a normal day in paradise. hey ho, tomorrows another day. as for the rash lulu, i\u2019ve had it from the start, neck face and chest. when it flairs up i look like i\u2019m sunburnt.i think everyone has these ups and downs throughout this but when it kicks in i get tunnel vision. that must be this health anxiety i\u2019ve been diagnosed with. i don\u2019t consider i\u2019m handling this well at all. i\u2019m usually one of those in control of things and if i\u2019m not i can usually adapt to it.panic set it to be fair with the shaking, as i haven't shaken like that since the early days.totally agree i have had an improvement over the past couple of weeks.a trip to a&e may be in order this week methinks.hope you and everyone have a good sleep,jim.",
          "\ud83d\ude02 funny how we imagine each other to look...you've made that easy now lulu...that did make me laugh.no takeaways here,lucky my son is an excellent cook and i'm trying to eat healthy, plenty of fruit and salad...but i did reward myself with a blueberry muffin after my walk today...well deserved x",
          "hi gail,agree sometimes you just have to have a bit of normality even if you have to face the consequences after.hope the wine went down well x",
          "oh that is interesting gail - every week we say we will get a takeaway and when saturday night comes we look at each other nervously (the same look as when the post comes through the letterbox .. lol) (my partner also neurotic after seeing me so ill) and make a lame excuse and put it off again! i've been drinking wine all the way through but have kept it to one glass a night which has been tricky.i hear you, i am so done with this - sick of thinking about how i feel, wondering what is going on in my body, am i going to have a coughing fit tonight, is my chest going to be tight tomorrow, am i going to have a sore throat (all possible) - i think all my friends and family are sick of it too!! i just feel that because i look better now everyone assumes i'm better and some days i still feel absolutely rubbish but hardly bother to mention it any more!glad you got out for a while, i desperately want to but just feel too nervous, don't mind being outside but haven't been in a shop for 12 weeks! it is unheard of i am normally popping into m&s food, zara, up the west end, here there and everywhere! can't imagine ever going back on the tube and i work in london - we are all wfh at moment but not sure how much longer that will go on.lx",

          "morning lulu and everyone i'm up early for the and for the score i'm going eight and three quarters i was going to go to nine but i now have woken with a headache and earache on and off all night dry inflammation but noticed chest not as tight yesterday or this morning been on my side though all night so that will probably turn up later i'm hoping to get to friday with less symptoms i'm hoping a lot of you have improved since last week gary",
          "morning!well really good that there has been some improvement gary but does show how slow it is with the 83/4!! but you are getting there! i have a feeling i'll be same but going to wait see how i feel once up and showered etc before i post my score as cant tell first thing so will post a bit later! i do think the headaches and overall dryness in respiratory tract makes you feel rubbish i'm same in mornings. assume this is the inflammation. am same with chest tightness never know when going to start do you still have phlegm anyone?hope everyone can see overall improvement this week - small steps in right direction . are we week 11 gary i've lost count?!lx",
          "i don't know about you but i got out of bed and felt the tightness of the chest feels like from my belly to my throat but what i have found when i keep myself straight it eases when i bend down can feel it walking is ok don't think will be able to stand up all day though we are week 11 will be 12 on friday looking for an anniversary drink my phlegm is there but minimal gary",
          "morning all,i think i'm staying on a 7 this week .plateau for me.fell asleep about 12.30 then awake at 3 till nearly 6 and then awake again at 8.headache and upper body aches,dry mouth and groggy,two hot sweats last night but felt freezing before a bath,the only thing that gets me warm.hope i make some headway this week.have a good day everyone x",
          "morning dawn yes i know what you mean i'm trying to work out how to get a good sleep in a row but i feel like the inflammation has other ideas i'm try to sort it but i'm afraid this is going to be the slow process the really bad headache that i had at the beginning has turned up so with earache that's eased but the headache nope took ibuprofen but it said no you can have it a bit longer enjoy your day gary x",
          "hi think i'm week 11 or 12 i'm giving myself a 9 this week so far, breathing feeling alot easier now still feel abit of mucas in chest and tired by evening but trying to stay up a bit longer now and have managed to cook dinner without hubby finishing them off, walked a bit further yesterday still getting pain uptop on back but abit easier yesterday and the odd headache, fingers crossed its stays like that \ud83d\udc9c",

          "morning dawn, i think we've all had plenty of plateau weeks along the way (maybe before we started scoring) so whilst a bit disappointing maybe to be expected - i think we are all so conscious of time at moment - whenever in our lives have we counted weeks so carefully?! unless on holiday and don't want to go home! hope you go straight to an 8 next week - i really do! my upper body aches badly but think that is because am sitting so much more - its different to the pain in the back. i too feel groggy in morning but gets better when up and at it! find the walking helps clear my head. as gary says am much better standing up as seems chests clears but tricky standing all day!i am going to jinx everything and go for a 9 - i definitely feel much more like my old self, am noticeably less tired (although still get tired but not like before), my skin looks a much better colour, my breathing overall is better (but still not right), i am walking 3 or 4 miles and doing steep hills, anxiety has pretty much gone (bubbles under the surface if i suddenly get a strange symptom even if not related to this!), am sleeping really well (better than before but think catching up on all the weeks i didn't sleep or literally only a few hours), can run up and down stairs again, heart rate and blood pressure have settled down - anyway as i said, how to jinx yourself in one post! but... surely we also need to be hopeful and positive too and recognise the progress we have made.have a good day everyone.lx",

          "hi danei started to get indigestion/heartburn a week or so ago. i had stomach churning at night which seemed to come with rapid heartbeat. i tried rennies but they had no effect. the doctor gave me omeprazole and that seems to have settled it down a lot. i don't know if it would work for you, but so far, i'm finding it helpful. wishing you all the best",
          "thanks joanne! helpful to know what works. i've had it since week 1 but didn't pay much attention to it because of all the other symptoms, but now it's got worse, probably because i ignored for so long...",
          "hi all i'm struggling to decide what score to give myself, so i think i'll play safe and stick at 7. i'm feeling more and more normal, just need to work on walking now. i was expecting to carry on from where i was before setback, but no, have to go right back. so it's slow slow walking with deep breathing.oh well here we go again ..enjoy your evenings :)",
          "hi joannesorry you've had a set back - it is no easy ride this is it? hoping you sort out the indigestion/heartburn and pick up again quickly and get back to where you were - i'm sure you will and be heading for an 8 next week \ud83e\udd1e take care,lx",
          "morning all up early with it today inflammation can feel it this morning feeling like a dragon definitely have to find the right position for the tight chest no good on my back its fine when up straight still headache and earache again but i did have that for a few days at the start so hopefully that will go soon tea and sos then walk for me hopefully you all had a good sleep gary",
          "morning alli find lying on front helps even for 10 mins or so when first get into bed but ive always slept like that but know some people find it tricky. how's the sore throat? mine came back last night and when i look there are bright red lesions on throat - no one has looked at this and been like this from day 1 - most of time not sore but seems to get worse when tired. wonder is this is just inflammation? come to conclusion this virus literally causes a fire throughout your body it is like burns in throat and lungs hence the dehydration - truly shocking! even my tongue!hope things settle down gary as day goes on i find it normally does until the eve! am off to see my lovely mum again and sit 2m apart in garden with masks on - all seems a bit surreal but so happy to be able to see her.lx",
          "morning lulu my throat is still sore i'm certain now it's the inflammation i'm taking andrographis and gensing for it hopefully starts to calm down soon its not stopped me going round the park a few times just hoping to get to the night when i don't need a drink ever couple of hours then i'm hoping it's going have a good time with your mum lulu catch up soon gary",
          "thanks lulu, yes i'll be after that 8 soon. have a lovely day with your mum.enjoy your day everyone :)",
          "morning joanne you'll get the 8 soon enough im going to ask a question for inflammation has anyone tried turmeric i'm taking andrographis and gensing but was just wondering if anyone has tried turmeric it says it is a good for inflammation thanks gary",
          "i'm taking turmeric, and drink a lot of turmeric tea with a spoon of honey. since michael, who was part of this group recovered as the first one.",
          "is it working?",
          "hi guys i've been taking a multivitamin that you put in water and drink it seems to be bucking me up i don't take anything else as dr said they might upset with other meds i'm taking. i do have breathe deep yogi tea as well which has helped my chest. enjoy your day and seeing your mum lulu,enjoy your day gary.",
          "thanks susan, just back she seems content and quite happy that is all i can hope for \ud83d\ude0dlx",
          "been moderated again...so annoying - probably because i mentioned a couple of brands!",
          "how you finding your getting on with the turmeric and honey maciek are you taking it as a turmeric and honey tea or adding turmeric supplements gary",
          "yes would be interesting to know about the tea, i'm drinking a regular store bought turmeric tea, not sure it's doing much but it tastes good! i'm also taking multivitamin that dissolves in drink. having a breathless day today :( spoke to gp this morning, starting lansoprazole for heartburn as its getting difficult to eat normally, have lost too much weight already.",
          "yes i know what you mean if it worked for michael like maciek says it got nothing to lose so i will give it a go gary",
          "don't remember a michael...after how many weeks did he recover?",
          "i take tablets high strength for holland and barrets, because it has pepper as well and it helps in absorption of turmeric. don't take it on empty stomach tough as it can give you heartburn. tea i drink same as michael did, 15 min brew active turmeric from pukka, when it cools down i add a large spoon of honey. it tastes lovely and helps with phlegm, i noticed less of it. but hard to say if it is honey or the tea ;) or just psychosomatic. tea also has ginger which has many benefits including anti inflamation and galangal which helps with digestion. it's not going to hurt you for sure.",
          "i do remember him coming on a few weeks back lulu will probably remember i'm useless when it comes to memory gary",
          "thanks for the answer maciek if it's not going to hurt i will give it a go i've just ordered it from amazon gary",
          "he recovered some 4 weeks ago i think it was after 6-7 weeks, if i remember correctly, but it looks like it was pretty straight forward recovery, without any relapses. but i can be wrong.",
          "it is hard to say what's working and what is not this days. i still have relapses, but not as strong as before. i take a lot of supplements including herbs, vitamins, minerals, proper probiotics, melatonin and mucolitics i also do saline inhalations with nebuliser and recently started ibuprofen and have percussion massages on my lungs done. it is like full time work, but slowly i get there, slowly. but recently future looks much brighter than before.",
          "hate when that happens.",
          "try, it is not expensive and it works. what really hurt me was nac that i took for too long. i started as soon as i had symptoms, it was great to take to help with the fight by i took it for too long and it kept my lungs inflamed for way too long and i think that's one of the reasons that it took me so long to recover. later specialist told me to stop taking it and it was a game changer. the only tip i could advice is to take vit k2 if you are using high doses of d3, there was a point that i took 8000units a day when i was at my worst, and it is quite a lot, now much less.",
          "hi maciek so have your lungs recovered now or not by your message they have how long did that take roughly for the recovery of your lungs and was the turmeric the help you needed do you think gary",
          "i'm drinking the same tea, and actually had some before when i was feeling really tight with breathlessness and heartburn and it did relax things a bit. like the idea of adding honey, will try that!",
          "hi gary ditto with ear ache i've got a sore throat but not a headache. as i mentioned before it feels like my glands are swollen especially under my left arm but i've noticed a swelling at the top of my right thigh. just wanted to ask if anyone has had anything similar ? got a call with my gp later, but thought i'd check with my very knowledgeable fellow sufferers first !!",
          "hi steph can't help you with that one but nothing surprises me with this anymore had a white circle come up on my elbow two weeks ago i think probably got it next week gary",
          "hi gary, not fully, what i still have mucus, not as much, breathlessness yes i have but not as strong. i don't have inflammation like i had, it felt like fire or pieces of glass in my lungs, every time i coughed was horrible. now i just have hypersensitive lungs and it is very easy to get an inflamed reaction. yes, it looks like i'm getting better. please don't get me wrong as i'm still not 100% there. in my humble opinion now i'm dealing with my body response, not fighting with virus per se, but with my immune response to it. that's why i focus now on taking everything that balances immune response and inflammation. i don't want to give hope or direct anyone to do the same things i do, because we are all different and have different symptoms, for example i never had shaking body like some people here. some also take different medicines and some of the stuff i take can interfere with some of the supplements, therefore i don't want to recommend anything. please have that in mind.",
          "thank you for your reply maciek and you are correct everyone is different i'm sort of an impatient person and i like to try and get on with it so if i'm seeing results for people it may also help others or not but i will try and get better if i can and if others are going to benefit as well i'm more than happy to help and i know good people like yourself will as well thank you gary",
          "i understand and you are right. it is just hard to judge what helps and what doesn't because of the waves. i believe that whatever we do helped, because we are still here, still alive. what are your symptoms now? how are you doing? where are you with your recovery?",
          "with regards to my symptoms i have a very dry mouth and sore throat which is probably due to the inflammation tight chest comes and goes and tingling hands very dry nights awake every couple of hours drinking water and trying to get back to sleep again and as to recovery i wish i knew gary",
          "i don't have dry mouth. i have tingling hands as well, but i don't connect them with covid as i was bed ridden for weeks before and i had it as well, because of the time i spent watching my phone, or tablet or reading a book - all time bend elbow it trapped nerve that goes to hands, but as soon as i came back to normal live it went away. so maybe it is the same for you? do you take any medicine that can cause dryness? sleeping pills?",
          "no i don't take any medication for anything except for ibcuprofen oralieve andrographis and gensing was i'm waiting for the lupid ibuprofen that's on its way i'm not on my bed a lot now except more night time been trying to make that much later gary also got the turmeric tea and k2 coming tomorrow gary",
          "in the past i tried some longines called fiorda and they were great, they are available on ebay. just paste on ebay: fiorda smak malinowym 30 past blony sluzowej oraz gard\u0142a i krtani for throatmaybe they will be worth trying? they are all natural. you can read description here: phytopharm. pl / en / fiorda-2 / just copy and google search ;)",
          "ok thanks so much maciek i'm sure i'll find them gary",
          "don't try it if you are lactose intolerant. it looks like we both tried so many thing, that one more won't harm ;) but seriously i looked for advice everywhere for all of the symptoms and things that they try, it is a shame that my gp was so unhelpful with my symptoms. looks like for him paracetamol is like snake oil, remedy for everything.",
          "i know what you mean mine didn't want to know that's why i spent so much time in the hospital and they were not much better but they were struggling with the unknown maybe they know a lot more now well i hope so gary",
          "i hope so too. i don't like to moan, what just struck me was lack of will to try new things and treatments. well at least my gp followed guidelines to the letter. if you decide to try fiorda and let me know how it worked? if it doesn't please don't blame me ;) maciek",
          "i will do and thank you gary",
          "michael posted to res not long ago that he is now back to full physical health and is running 10k. from what i remember he suffered from breathlessness and chest pain etc. i think he also suffered badly from anxiety at the time and still dealing with that but much better. he definitely struggled the same as the rest of us - got a feeling he might be quite young (no idea why i think that but i just do!) so that may have speeded up his recovery but the main thing is he got there. be great to hear how things are going for you michael if you read this and apologies if i have got any of this info wrong!lx",
          "yes i remember it's probably on one of the pages but i don't fancy going through all them good that he has kicked on from there as well might leave the 10 k till i hit 60 you're do that before me \ud83d\ude02 i did over do it today hope don't pay for it later another day tomorrow enjoy your evening lulu bet it was nice to see your mum gary",

          "lulu,michael posted the other day.its on here somewhere.jim.",
          "enjoy gary, hope it gives you relief for your symptoms. tried it with honey, didn't love it, and actually then read honey isn't good for acid stomach so won't do that again. my diet is getting so bland, literally eating for health rather than enjoyment...oh well, you do what you can.speaking of all those pages to find michael, do you guys think it's time to continue this thread on another page so it doesn't take a year to scroll down?",
          "yes i know what you mean thats fine if you want to move to another page dane i think you just start another new discussion and it starts a new page i think gary",
          "what will i do before you hit 60 or the 10k?!! i know makes you so nervous doesn't it if you do too much - i am wondering if the evening sore throat will make an appearance. don't understand this illness why some nights you get symptoms and some you don't but it never seems to go away completely - just lingers. presumably they just get less and less ?i really hope so for all of us. it was prosecco tuesday on the green for me so have had a nice day all in all. hope everyone has a good evening/night.lx",
          "hi jimyes think i found that one - it was the one where he said about doing 10k run and he was fully physically fit as you say was quite recent - be good to know if still doing well i really hope so - reckon if you are running 10k must be feeling better!!hope you are doing ok jim and you can see some improvement again.lx",
          "hi lulu yes i just don't get it i thought earlier i would take a taxi to the park about 4 miles away and have a good walk through a picnic with me then walk back pushed it a bit but we gotta try now drinking turmeric tea and honey instead of beer this is what it's come to just like you i feel the sore throat is inflammation i guess nattering doesn't help either \ud83d\ude02 enjoy the rest of your evening young lady gary",
          "let us know how does it taste for you?",
          "it actually tastes like drinking some wood and honey not that i've ever drank wood but if it works i will eat a tree gary",
          "not really lulu.it's another bad day in paradise.",
          "wood and honey...yum... :) the taste does grow on you i have to say",
          "i hope you're right and it's just the taste \ud83d\ude02",
          "i must say at first it was odd, but now i love it, i think i'll still drink it when it is all over.",
          "ha ha, brilliant. at first i didn't like this either, but now i really do and think that i'll still drink it when it is all over. now i drink at least 5 a day ;) alongside other drinks.",
          "blimey it should be only one of your five a day maciek your going to have twigs coming out of your earholes \ud83d\ude02 i will stick with it and drink the box of twenty gary",

          "haha, i drink quite a lot, always was, but with this sickness i drink even more it just helps me with mucus and other symptoms.",
          "haha recovering from this is for me like a job. my all day is around recovering and focusing on getting better. if 5 teas is a lot i shouldn't mention how many different supplements and tablets i take :) i just cannot wait for the day when i would say i feel 100%",
          "if it works i'm all for it and good to know it helps gary",
          "sounds like you had a nice day though gary and good mentally to get out and have a change of scene.i ended up with 10 boxes of the pukka tumeric tea on the recommendation of someone on here - thought i'd bought one box but it was ten boxes - thought was a bit pricey at the time!! - then decided not to drink it as might stain teeth (was just thinking if you get tumeric on work top it badly stains) anyone found this? everyone i know will be getting a box of tumeric tea for christmas!lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone same night dry and long and yes did push it yesterday so tired but will drink the sos and turmeric and honey tea then hit the park going to the kids this morning so i'm hoping you all had a good night gary",

          "if my throat becomes sore it is normally in the evening so probably is related to talking a lot and also i think if i have not drunk enough water - when i wake up throat is normally of but am coughing a lot and phlegm is bad - seems more of a productive cough at the moment can feel it moving in back - anyone else felt this?just going for antibody test - decided to pay privately - 190 quid - had to have telephone consultation first with private doctor at hospital (think that is to ascertain you are not still infectious and she seemed happy i wouldn't be after this time) asked if i'd had any covid symptoms \ud83d\ude44- \"have you got a spare hour or two and i'll tell you all about them ! we definitely know more than most gps about this i am convinced of that.anyway blood test at 11.15 and results tomorrow or friday.hope you pick up later gary and everyone has a good day.lx",

          "hi dawn!glad you got out it does make things feel more normal. i feel anxious every time i step outside unless i'm walking in the forest but anywhere there are surfaces to touch and people nearby! i went to hospital for antibody test this morning and i'm trying to open doors with elbows and keeping more than 2m distance - people looking at me as if i'm nuts \ud83d\ude33i have wine every night with dinner just take the edge of things - have to try very hard to stick to just one glass! felt a bit down since my #9 on monday!! chest has felt quite heavy and generally more chesty last couple of days - no idea why - i told you i'd jinx it! just walked 4.2 miles and climbed equivalent of 20 flights of stairs so i spose things could be worse but just fed up with not feeling right! sorry to hear about your sleep that must be really tough.how long have you been signed off for in total? i've been off work 9 weeks and sick note runs out this friday - just feels like such a long time but feel like need more time - trouble is the weeks go so fast and the improvement is so slow and up and down.lx",

          "not sure if anyone has mentioned this already but notice online there is a post-covid hub website google post-covid hub (if i put a link it will get moderated) and there is a team of respiratory specialist you can phone - also can't put phone number as it will get moderated.!lx",
          "yes diane obviously no chance but we all feel like that to try and get rid of little sugar hopefully your having a good day gary",
          "*hi dawn i thought that with my last sick note i don't care about work for the moment going to worry about that in a few weeks enjoy your wine will taste better than my wood gary *",
          "there is also a survey on the website asking about your symptoms, how you feel, anything else you feel would help your recovery etc. they are obviously now gathering information of people who have been ill so they can provide more support. just filled it in - didn't take long and also mentioned again about the real recovery time not being mentioned enough.lx",
          "hi lulu got to spend some time with the girls my boy went out probably had enough of it don't blame him it's hard to explain what you cant see had to come home started feeling funny sat down too much weird but my hands start tingling and my chest then gets tight have you tried the post covid hub yet gary",
          "i rang them got through to someone who i was talking to going through things she said she would get a nurse to give me a call back so i was explaining to her then got cut off she said she had had it but different symptoms will have a look at the survey now lulu done the survey i feel now like they are finally starting to know about us now gary",
          "ahh lulu,sorry you've not been feeling great ,it does seem to bring you back down sometimes but you are doing so well ,just think how far you have come.its true how fast the weeks go though and the progress is slow,think we are all impatient just to be back to our normal selves.tried to have a rest on the sofa this afternoon and even though i've got a long sleeve top ,sweat top and and throw over me and the heating is on i've been getting tingles all up my body like i'm cold.so i've been off work 8 weeks today so i'm just hoping by week 10 i can start back ,first week would only be 2 days .will just have to wait and see but that's what i'm aiming for .but your right gary don't worry about work ,health is more important .you are good with the wine lulu ,can't promise it will be just the one ! \ud83d\ude02 x",
          "that's annoying perhaps ring back when you feel up to it and see if you can speak to them again. i know i feel everyone thinks you \"look\" ok but can't see or understand you are still suffering - must be hard for your kids.when you think we were in the first group of people to get infected with this just before lock down so i suppose healthcare officials are only just becoming aware of all these ongoing health problems we are suffering and recognising that people are still experiencing problems months later.lx",
          "sorry to hear this dawn - pretty miserable when you can't even get cosy on the sofa for an afternoon rest - i've not had the tingling etc. but have never had a temperature all the way through. so many horrible symptoms.so we are about the same time off work - i am definitely going to get signed off again - feel need more time to try and get symptoms more stable for longer periods time without the relapses. i'll have to reintroduce myself to my boss when i eventually go back - i'll be like the new girl!yep that's the rule definitely only one glass of wine a night, with a little top up here and there but hey that's still only one glass - right?!!\ud83d\ude1clx",
          "i have just had my work on the phone asking me how i feel told them exactly what they didn't want to hear but felt its time to ask for professional advice and support told me that they will sort it and they said don't worry about work and i said i'm not just gotta get them working for me now will ring me back tomorrow i will ring back covid hub after my chat with work tomorrow gary",
          "i think you've done the right thing gary - i think our employers need to know/understand we are all still struggling and glad they were supportive.i will ring my gp friday and ask to be signed off for another two weeks then see how things go from there.lx",
          "yes i've told them basically i haven't had flu like symptoms for 12 weeks on friday they were really good so hopefully they come up with someone in the know have to wait and see i suppose gary",
          "gary,just found the post coivid hub via google.i've completed their survey being extremely honest about the lack of help/assistance/empathy via health care professionals etc even mentioning the 999 call to ambulance that never turned up but received a telephone call 4 hours later,i'll call them tomorrow morning at 9:15 when they open.hope your on the up,jim.",
          "same here, just done it. hopefully it will change something for others.",

          "morning lulu and everyone i put a new discussion on not sure where it went but basically had a bad day yesterday chest really got tight hands going crazy tingling long dry night feels like the inflammation has moved up weird like it got warmer as well waking up all the time going to get on to the hub if i hear nothing from work first ask for a phone call from a nurse see what happens hopefully you all had a better night gary",
          "morning gary,i have read the post covid hub from cover to cover and will be contacting them his morning.there are numerous study papers attached, some of which cover rehabilitation post covid.i am not aware of anyone on this forum being referred to the relevant parties,we should be doing specific exercises, breathing exercises and sputum removal via oscillation devices and/or physiotherapy.i will be taking all of this up with my gp tomorrow at during my telephone appointment.oh its the start of week ten today, it's never bloody ending.take care,jim.",
          "that's where its all gone wrong jim there are probably lots of things we should have been doing now my gp is not very well good so i will try to sort it out through work or the covid hub week 10 times flown i hope you start feeling a lot better now just let's crack on and try and get ourselves sorted gary",
          "agreed.",
          "morning jim, it is a shame that our gps ignored us and i'm glad that i had this group and there was google to help with recovery. please could you be so kind and message me a link to article about rehabilitation and oscillation device, i've been using air physio device for little while and would like to see if it was the right tool. thank you maciek",
          "ive spoken to them already jim and they will getting a nurse to ring me back she mentioned my gp and i'm sorry i laughed i tried to explain that i told my gp about three weeks ago my symptoms and she said i was fine to go back to work then she said they understand the virus more now and maybe it was worth trying again so my work haven't got back to me so maybe i'll try the gp again gary",
          "ive replied.which breath device are you using?",
          "morning all, sorry you had a difficult day yesterday gary. i think i will also try the hub. so just in case i was getting bored of my symptoms, a delightful new one has appeared...conjunctivitis! can't believe it, i'm week 12.5! it woke me in middle of the night, my right eye was streaming tears and this morning sent pictures to gp who said it's conjunctivitis. need to start topical antibiotics. asked the doc if this means i still have the virus, she couldn't answer. i thought people got this during early symptoms....aaargh!!!",
          "yes dane i know what you mean they won't answer correctly its so annoying garston medical centre is the worst but i've got to try something so good luck with the hub i'm not sure if they will ring you straight away that's what i was hoping for probably monday will have to hope for a better day gary",
          "seems like the hub is busy, was told will speak to a nurse next week. lovely lady on the phone though. you have to be your own advocate with this, find the gps are happy to treat specific symptoms but are not really considering the overall picture.",
          "it is called air physio, you can see on youtube or get it on amazon. it is great it really helped me a lot when my wife was at work and could not do percussion massage on my lungs.",
          "i know dane i finally got through to my gp and they gave me a different one again and i told her what was going on now and that she should have a note from the hospital to say that they have put me into their care now and i told her that i could not sleep due to the inflammation tight chest asked her what the tingling of the hands were and she said due to breathing too much etc then a little while later asked me if i'm exercising and when i said yes but you can't over excise because it won't let you so basically you are getting better but we all know it will take time and i said so am i going to live or die don't think that went down too well but she said will be ok gary",
          "have you tried ibuprofen gary?i started this with ginseng, quercetine and other staff. in 5 days there is a massive improvement, my mucus is almost completely gone no signs of inflammation and what i have now is hypersensitive lungs, for pollen and dust, perfumes and other irritants, but i wear n95 mask which helps. but no other symptoms. if it continues improving like that it looks like i'll try to back to work on monday, fingers crossed.maciek",
          "i've started to take the flarin ibuprofen maciek at the moment for my condition i'm drinking turmeric and honey tea and taking flarin ibuprofen my phlegm is minimal i was also going to to take k2 but i also take vitimin d so i'm not sure if i need to take any more ginseng or andrographis i don't want to over do it gary will it be too much for me?",
          "what i've recently done i stopped ginseng and andrographis as i hit plateau with them. take vit k2 as it is very important when you take vit d, specially high doses of it. it is to prevent from veins calcification, from overdosing vit d3. k2 is also good for heart's health. this is just my experience, not medical advice.my doctor told me to rest and take paracetamol if i have to :d",
          "thank you maciek so if i take vitimin d k2 the tea i can take whenever the flarin 3 times a day how would i be to take the victim d in the morning and the k2 in the afternoon or does it not matter gary",
          "how many units of vit d do you use?",
          "the vitamin d is 12.5ug and the k2, is 200 i've not took vitamins till this little sugar turned up gary",
          "i'm 40 yo and do not have any previous conditions. i take 1x25 micrograms of vit d3 every 8h and 1x 50 micrograms of vit k2 in 1x in the morning with vit d and one in the evening so every 12h when it all started i was taking double of both of them. i wanted to get to almost vit d3 hammer dose.",
          "i also take zinc and quercetine and omega 3 oil.",
          "so i should be ok to take the victim d in the morning and the k2 in the afternoon do i still need to take the flarin 3 times a day with them that's the one i'm concerned about i'm 58 with no underline conditions i'm also walking about 3 miles a day gary",
          "why are you concern about flarin? do you have stomach ulcer?history of intestine bleeding? are you alergic to it? do you feel unwell after taking it? do you take any other medicines like blood thinners? or any regular like for high blood pressure?",
          "no no it's just because it's ibuprofen and three times a day is a lot for me anyway i never used to take anything very rare i was ill so it's all new to me but like i said before if it gets me better i will eat it gary",
          "garry it is your choice. i've never had anything even remotely similar to that. but i believe in science and medicine not in voodoo and healing crystals. ;) but if they help some people i'm ok with that. i'm not taking random tablets, but only those that, from scientific and clinical research are proven to work with other similar illnesses. i found out recently that now they talking about k2 for covid (you can google it) please don't get me wrong (i think it is time for my rant ;) ) so here we go: my gp didn't recommend any of them, he just said to do nothing and take paracetamol. if i listened to him i probably would end up much worse state than i am now, eg. with pneumonia, like some people who decided to do listen to the book and saying that doctor is always right. my mum was very ill and she managed to live for 14 years when her life expectation after diagnosis was only 5 years. if we listened to her gp we wouldn't try everything we did to help her with her terminal illness. that's why i will always question their abilities and knowledge that unfortunately is not updated since they leave medical school. with corona there are daily developments and gps at least mine do not read or do not care about people with mild symptoms, like us. i know that there are other doctors who try to help like for example dr marik. i'll be forever thankful for his and other researchers help that gave me some hope and direction for my recovery by making their researches easy accessible to the public. rant over ;) maciek",
          "i do appreciate and agree with you maciek and i will not sit on my back side and not do nothing if i can get better and go back to normal way of life i am all for it and everyone knows what i think about gp s that's why i will drink wood and honey and take ibuprofen and vitamins if i feel it will help me recover i'm all for it and thank you for your advice and help and i hope all goes well for you when you go back to work and everyone else on here who have had to struggle to get help that they shouldn't have had to my rant over gary",
          "i just want to be honest gary about one thing, i do not know if ibuprofen works or not. all i can say what i just noticed, that since i started taking it 5 days ago and since then there is a massive improvement, but would there be any if i did not take it? who knows? i always remember that correlation is not causation, therefore if more people would try it then we will have the answer sooner and could help others. maciek",
          "i if there is an improvement i can't see the problem not taking it maciek so i will if no sign of side affects that is fine thanks you gary",
          "please keep me updated. thank you",
          "**will do and thank you gary **",
          "afternoon, bit late to the party for me today!well i've had my anti-body test result and it has come back negative. to say i am gutted/confused is an understatement and has raised so many questions. this was the abbott one carried out in hospital and so should be accurate. if i have not had c-19 what the hell have i had? i have no underlying health issues, never get chest infections but 12 weeks on am still having breathing issues, inflamed lungs and coughing up buckets of phlegm. the respiratory consultant could see residue in my lungs and small lung damage on right side but did tell me that the tests could show a false negative but the ones done in hospital (either roche or abbott) are more accurate. the doctor who rang with test results couldn't explain it but mumbled something about whether i'd left it too long to be tested as it it 3 months. i have emailed respiratory consultant to find out what his views are.work have been asking if i've had the anti-body test - now what do i say - well i've been off work 10 weeks but didn't have it??! i am so sick of this whole illness - none of the tests seems to be accurate (receptionist at hospital told me had loads of people getting false readings for the \"have you got it\" swab tests) i genuinely cannot believe i have had some other chest infection at exactly the same time covid took off which did not respond to the two lots of antibiotics i was given - what are the chances of that? i am 100% positive i've had covid - the specialist seemed to think i have from the ct scan and damage he could see so now i have spent 200 quid, feel like i have imagined the whole awful experience and am more confused than ever. hope everyone else is having better days. in fact i actually feel quite good today after a rubbish day yesterday!lx",
          "i said the same thing to my gp today and they can't answer you so i'm expecting exactly the same thing when i have the antibodies test im sure some one else said a little while ago that they had the same if i was you i would tell work the truth because i feel like they probably are going to get lots more people in the country the same just like when i went to hospital half way through when i thought i was going to die and my swabs came back negative i knew they was wrong and the nurse told me that they were not 60 percent accurate these tests are going to happen to people who have genuinely had it they couldn't tell me if it wasn't covid what was it then the doctor said you have had it but are now in recovery and the next time they gave me a letter flu like symptoms i laughed when i saw it and still in recovery honestly wouldn't give two hoots about it they are wrong gary",
          "which of the test did you have, if you do not mind me asking? i'm asking about a manufacturer, please?",
          "i had the abbott test and had the blood taken in hospital and sent off to lab.lx",
          "one thing i know for sure now gary is i am not going to let anyone near me with a vaccine any time soon - all these tests seemed to have been rushed through with the manufacturers having pound note signs in their eyes and they have had minimal trials. this whole thing has been a complete sh*t show it really has - no support, no tests available when first got ill, when tests become available they are not accurate, gps don't have a clue am convinced we know more than they do.seriously fed up with it all. tempted to go back to work next week and just suffer in silence - when i speak to my brother i can hear from his voice that he thinks i am exaggerating it all, my partner is fed up hearing about it so even if i do feel ill can't say too much now. think will just go back to normal and hope for the best.feeling sorry for myself in case you hadn't guessed!!lx",
          "just sent you a message lulu, maybe this will help you dealing with the results? we know, what we went through. don't worrymaciek",
          "the trouble is it takes over our lives so much others feel like they are left out i've just rang my daughters one is asleep now and the other was like i'm really busy dad so i just said ok i was only ringing to see if you are ok ended up saying sorry and would ring later but even though they can't see how i'll we are we have to concentrate on ourselves and it is hard when the people you care about are not listening gary",
          "oh lulu,how confusing,could it be that you have had it but not built immunity, i did hear of cases like that from china.so difficult to understand,glad you're feeling a bit better today though.think i missed the covid hub thing online ,does it have a specific name ? new symptom i seem to be burping a lot ,don't feel like i have acid reflux as in the burning in stomach ect but when i drink hot liquid like tea it hurts my throat and chest.i've got some indigestion meds i had a while back when i was taking a lot of inflammatory meds after knee op so might try those.i just ordered some cbd oil too. sorry to read some of you are suffering again, my brain fog gets overwhelmed reading all the posts ,i need to check in more often to stay updated.hope you're all having a better day x",

          "hi gary,totally get it,i feel like a hypochondriac sometimes and must sound like one too to others that just don't understand.trying to act normal when you really don't feel it is exhausting in its self.frightened to say i'm having a good day because you then feel like they think you're dragging out your illness by then having a bad day.....like we really want to be feeling like this.well i'm having another glass of wine tonight after a glass and a half yesterday and having to practically crawl up the stairs with exhaustion i slept so much better. x",
          "i know same with my boys and many of my friends they lost interest several weeks ago! thanks everyone for your support - really appreciate it x",
          "it seems easier just to say \"i'm fine\" because that is about as much most people want to hear! yep the wine definitely helps relax you and if you are sleeping better that is a win win situation!sorry to hear about the burping situation! - i've definitely had indigestion with this so maybe similar thing.lx",
          "i know dawn probably the best thing to do is get the bottle out and crack on be such a good day when we can finally do it with out worrying about dry mouth in the morning gary",
          "ok i tthink we have to go to page 6 4 guys and girls gary",
          "so sorry to hear about your test results, lulu. it must be so frustrating as we know we've all had it, so there must be something wrong with the test. don't go back to work too soon though, because it's not worth becoming ill again.i was interested to read about the many symptoms of chest congestion including tight chest, cough, sore throat, fever/chills, heartburn, and more. it sounds like my symptoms now are to do with this and not the original virus, although that is what caused it all x",
          "thanks jo, just feel confused - i suppose we just all want answers and confirmation. i think the other possibility is that you just have not made anti-bodies not sure if that is possible - will have to google it!it has just made me feel that i have imagined it all or exaggerated it and i know deep down that is not me - have been desperate to get this cr&p out of my life and get back to normal.yep i think we are now all dealing with the fall out from the virus. just don't understand how you can feel better for several days then relapse - i felt bad yesterday but pretty good today - why? i genuinely do not know other than tuesday i hardly walked and then yesterday felt really chesty and breathless but went for long walk yesterday which gets me coughing and today felt less congested - i definitely think the walking helps clear chest and sitting around too much doesn't.take care.lx",
          "hi dawni've had the burping for the last couple of weeks, and the churning stomach to go with it. it's improved since taking capsules from doctor for heartburn/indigestion. i tried rennies but they weren't strong enough. hope it improves soon x",
          "hi joanne,yes i have some omeprazole so i'm going to try those to see if they help.pleased to hear its helped you .so unlady like \ud83d\ude02 x",

          "i wouldn't have any test done as they all seem to be incorrect, we can't all be feeling the same and the symptoms we all have been the same. the dr in hospital said i had it so did my gp, i don't think the tests are 100% so don't worry lulu",
          "still think they should have checked us all out better in early days, my friend in greece her mum a gp and she thinks it terrible how we all got ignored and not checked out unless we went to hospital. her aunt in russia has it and phemonia her dr visits her everyday at home. it's not been fair.",
          "yes i think you are right, regret having it done but everyone kept asking me if i'd been tested. i have found it is almost like people do not believe you or maybe that is me just being paranoid?!! anyone else felt this? i missed having the original test as not available and felt the need but definitely wish i hadnt now.lx",
          "i missed the original test as it wasn't out when we all came down with it, it's not us being paranoid as we all just want to be normal again. i started coughing today again and i thought oh no i'm getting it again its just this bloody after effect, that dr on facebook said she's had effects for 5 months now and she's fit and a athlete normally but she up and down like us. she said we should all have been amitted for obs ervation when we all had it bad instead of just being at home suffering on our own, she has anxiety like all of us which she said effects us more. they need to be looking into follow ups for us all now.",
          "i agree - i spoke to doctor's receptionist today to get another sick note and she spoke to doctor then said to me - oh the doctor said if you still not well maybe give him a ring!! really?? they know from my notes that i've been ill for 12 weeks you think the doctor might ring me! i think ultimately we all know there is very little the gps can do they are just stabbing in dark prescribing random meds - if i hadn't seen the respiratory specialist and had the ct scan i would be a lot more worried than i am. i really feel for the people who haven't had the opportunity to see someone privately and think gary is right you are better boycotting gps and go straight to a&e if you want anything checked out.lx",

          "sorry caroline i couldn't help but notice they told me that i had a chest infection as well they got it wrong i took the antibiotics till the third day went back to a and e they must have checked the xrays properly then because the doctor said you haven't got a chest infection and the antibiotics made me really sick so just be careful gary",
          "im on steriods and antibotic , not got any worst but no improvement . oxygen is ok , heart rate up , blood pressure low (normal for me ) temp low . was going to ring doc tomorrow morning . what happen with you when they thought it was chest infection ?",
          "so sorry to hear you are in the thick of it still caroline. can only say from a little further down the line don't get too dis-spirited.it crawls slowly in the right direction. hopefully you will get there quicker than some of us!"

          "yes this new doctor just mentioned chostochondritis. it was so good to have a doctor actually have a suspicion of what it is! she even did a magnetic pulse therapy on my chest which is supposed to help. and gave me some natural immunity boosting supplements. even just having a doctor finally telling me to do more than just rest and stop worrying made me feel so much better. i hope this all works!",

          "look into getting a spirometer. it is a plastic contraption for breathing exercises and costs $13 or so.antibiotics did nothing for me either. i had chest pain and bad fatigue when i was at my worst. a doctor just put me on some supplements, including vitamin k and probiotics for immune system bolstering and artemisinin (an anti malarial plant) to combat the covid.",
          "me too john, week 11 monday.noone, including the neurologist was able to clearly tell me what the tingling is about. it is very disconcerting. best the neurologist could give me was that maybe it's similar to migraine aura where the electrical signals in the brain are going a little haywire and causing nerve sensitivity etc. given covid causes vascular issues and issues within the blood vessels like migraine it could certainly be that, but all very vague i'm afraid. truth is, they haven't a clue. glad you found us though john. if i do find out more i will let you know!",

          "hi rufio, thanks for your reply. i'm pretty sure my rib pain is from my cough. i've been coughing a lot these last few days, quite violently, and it's only since then that the pain has started. it's on the left side going round under my arm directly under my chest muscle. intercostal muscles are the ones that i have strained i think. it's the first time in 12 weeks that i've had this but i seem to be coughing a lot more, suddenly. here you can see a private specialist pretty quick but it costs more than many can afford, but most of us have to wait for the national health service to get time to see us. i think we have very different health services in the way they are funded and run. i like the sound of the electromagnetic field therapy. it's not mentioned here, no idea if we have it. hope you feel better soon and that the chest inflammation heals quickly. a year sounds pretty bad, but as long as it eventually goes that's the main thing. all the best.",

          "hi res, i'm very sorry you're still here, although i mean that in the nicest possible sense!!! good to hear from you though . thanks for the info on h2 blockers. it's got to be worth a try and yes, i don't get the point of antibiotics if there's no definite bacterial infection, they're just making us low and possibly killing off the good stuff in our systems. i'm not convinced on the asthma thing either, i think the nurse, who is very attentive and nice, is just trying to help me. she has referred me to the specialist which is great (at bloody last) and she said he/she may tell me to stop taking inhalers and will test my breathing strength too, so i think i'd rather wait. thanks for your input on that one, it helps me to make a decision. all the best to you.",
          "stuart, just to say we all received an email from the patient forum to say they would no longer be sending emails every time some one posted a message. that's the reason you're no longer in the loop lol. hopefully we'll all be on the same page soon so that we can support and help each other through these dark times. i'm sure we'll all get there and hopefully get to enjoy the summer be it the new norm, but for now we've got to concentrate on getting better the best way we can. my doctor prescribed me an inhaler for my breathing but i've found it makes it worse. all my gp appointments have been over the phone so how can they gauge what's going on with us !!! i've had an chest xray early on in hospital and they keep referring to that saying it was ok but how do they know that now !! so frustrating suffering like this.",
          "i got that email steph but mr nobrain here didn't really understand it! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 concerning inhalers, yeah i had a ventolin one to start with, but it was useless. now the nurse wants me to try a brown one that's a steroid inhaler, but she said it will be two weeks before i see an improvement and i must take it for two months at least. i'm not convinced, and will wait to see the respiratory specialist although that could be weeks. whether i'm making a bad decision... i don't know. all my appointments have been on the phone too. it's not ideal. and i agree about the xray, how can it be taken as accurate after all this time? really you should be getting a fresh one to make sure. i had one too that showed a blockage or collapsed area on my left lung. like you say, that might be temporary and gone now, or maybe there is more. no idea, but my next xray isn't until middle of july. it doesn't help one's piece of mind but i am trying to stay positive. i live in hope that tomorrow will always be better. take care steph.",
          "hi stuartnice to hear from you!yep we are all over the place on here ! sorry about the relapse i too have been feeling better but still get bad days when chest is heavy and breathing painful and still coughing up phlegm \ud83d\ude2b my gp gave me a blue inhaler right at the very beginning which i didn't use and when i checked with respiratory consultant about using it he told me not to - he said lungs are very inflamed and hyper sensitive and should not introduce anything into them - he just recommended steam inhalation but obviously check with your guy when you get to see him. i really think they are stabbing in the dark and because the symptoms are similar to asthma they go down that route.anyway here's hoping it is only a small blip and you will feel better soon.lx",
          "hi stuart sorry we've been on a different page sorry about your relapse we all know what that is like just gotta get back up again its hard enough dealing with it at home as well i tried to go back to work myself too early as well put me on my back side again i'm lucky work will wait until i'm ok otherwise i would have to go like you hopefully something will come out of talking to the nurse i'm hoping you have some good days now because i'm week 12 tomorrow and i'm still having bad days may be my gp and lulu were right we gotta be looking at 4 months gary",

          "yeah, i couldn't find that one either as is apparently now prescription only. i found the last two packs of rinitadine though at my local pharmacy which is another h2 blocker that is sadly being discontinued due to safety issues with long term use as it has traces of some chemical in it that can be dangerous above an acceptable level .i just want to road test it for a couple of weeks though and see if it helps. short term use is fine by me!",
          "hi lulu, thanks for your reply. sorry you're still suffering with this damned thing! you and i sound pretty similar. what week are you at now? thanks for the inhaler info. i think that pretty much seals it for me. i won't be bothering with the inhalers. the steam sounds good. do you add anything to it like menthol or olbas oil? all the best lulu, have a great evening.",
          "hey gary, i see you're still fighting little sugar! 12 weeks for me too tomorrow. maybe we should throw a party to celebrate!don't worry about the different page, i should have come looking. i'm so grateful for this forum but it's not the most intuitive site i've been on. we all need some positive news i think gary, something has to happen. i'm not giving up though. nice to hear from you. have a good evening.",
          "don't think it's even available on prescription :(getting really down with all of this...week 12 and just checked, got a low fever again. can't take a deep breath in now, chest feels achy, eyes a bit stingy, heartburn...hope it gets better soon for all.",

          "i've lost count lol! ask gary! think we are going into week 12? he said just steam don't add anything because of the sensitivity of lungs - made sense to me. friends kept telling me to use the inhaler but i just had a feeling not to and was so glad i waited and checked.hope you are back on track soon.lx",
          "hi dane, i did have one a few weeks ago which showed some damage and i'm told i need to wait two months for another to give it time to see if it has healed. if i get worse i will do though. the rib pain is due to violent coughing, pretty sure. thanks for your concern. take care.",
          "oh i see, then yes best to wait as the lungs do take time to heal. gosh hope your coughing settles down.",

          "hi ,yes guess we were pretty exposed.thanks for the advice i will look into it.i've been taking a multi vitamin but just checked and no vit d in it .just made a turmeric hot drink with honey not sure this is correct way to have it yet but it can't do any harm.also just recieved my oil hoping this will help with anxiety...as i know it has worked before for me x",

          "hi gary,well i just put a teaspoon of turmeric into some hot water with the same honey.my breathing does seem a lot better around the house but the chest tightness and breathlessness kicks in more when walking out ,could that be inflammation?yep 2 nights now with 5 hours straight off ,hoping for the same tonight...theres still some wine left in the bottle \ud83d\ude02oh and happy anniversary to you 12 weekers ...not that happy seems to be the right word in this case .think the day may come when we should all get together and celebrate properly ! our little covid family",
          "yes dawn i think the inflammation was why we were getting the sweats at night and the dry mouth yes totally agree with you i would definitely be up for a good drink when we are all over this 2metres though and i would have such a smile on my face that day i can tell you gary",
          "hows the earache now gary ? ,you said you had blood on your pillow has it eased a little ?it seems like it goes through your whole body.i had my left jaw right up to my ear ache for a whole week a while back ..someone said you must be grinding teeth but i don't see how as my mouth must have been open the whole time with my breathing difficulties. it still a bit stiff now .never actually written down all my symptoms but it's a bloody long list that's for sure .maybe i should and count how many \ud83d\ude02 think i'm bored x",
          "yes last night wasn't a good one woke up with a circle on my pillow could see it was blood nothing on my nose and had earache and headache from hell so i checked my ears but no blood weird yes be a few more coming i suppose gary",
          "hi gracey lovely to hear from you. sorry to hear you've had the paramedics out again with heart , i've had them 3 times too. sounds like you've been proactive with docs and hopefully it helps.",
          "hope you get a better one tonight gary ...up to 25 on my list !yep we'll all celebrate once this madness is over x",
          "that's rubbish sorry to hear that stuart but i too have noticed that any stress can affect the breathing and chest tightness - things have been a bit \"aggy\" around here at times (to say the least) and if i get annoyed or stressed i immediately feel it in my chest. i think breathing is something until now we have all obviously taken for granted and not had to think or worry about but now we are all highly sensitive to it and we are aware of any changes in our breathing - it's just so bloody stressful and this is something no-one else, that hasn't had this, can understand. i think we are all just worn out with it all - i literally feel sometimes i just can deal with it any more - feel like you want to rip your chest open and see what the hell is going on in there.take it easy, lx",
          "yep it's like pick n' mix - shall i have the sore throat and breathing issues today or shall i go for the pain in lung and full blown cough - oh no i had that yesterday, i'll try the metallic taste and bald tongue today.. never ending \ud83d\ude44",
          "ahh hang in there lulu,it is so tiring and stressful it brings you down but you have been such a strength to us all here and we really appreciate it . x",
          "do they work for you?",
          "i'm not sure yet need more time had a bad night though woke up feeling awful headache and earache and blood spot on the pillow but that's happened before not the blood don't feel good today but still taking them might need few more days to tell sorry that's meant for maciek",
          "replied to dawn sorry have you seen it gary",
          "thanks dawn, think the lack of antibodies has hit me hard - that was always my silver lining - worth going through this cra8p if you get some antibodies. specialist replied to my email asking what his take was on me testing negative and below is his reply. he also forward me an article about the tests and reliablity - same one which maciek kindly private messaged me.thank you for your message. it is a bit surprising but the antibody test does have false negative rate. also we still don\u2019t know how long the antibodies last in our body and whether people with mild disease develop any antibodies at all? having said that there can be other viruses as well which can cause respiratory symptoms.it may be impossible to determine retrospectively what else could it have been to cause your symptoms if not covid- but i would like to reiterate that we still don\u2019t know everything about covid and also about antibody test. you are now getting better and worrying is not going to solve anything. as mentioned in my consultation we will catch up again to see how are getting on and if necessary carry out more testing.",
          "yes ican understand that lulu it would have been the confirmation of having the virus too.you know your own body and seems strange and very unlikely to get such an illness at the same time as covid .easy for specialist to say well you're getting better but it doesn't give you the answers you need. has anybody else on here had the antibody test and had a positve.. just trying to find some common ground as in i wonder if all us long termers have not built antibodies hence why our bodies are still behaving the way they are ..just a thought .read somewhere about how we could still be fighting the ghost of this virus .it's just all so complicated x",
          "my friend has very mild symptoms back in early march when she was in us - literally aches and pain for 3/4 days no respiratory issues at all - she has just done the finger prick one and has come back positive. the article he sent says the approved tests (roche and abbott) although state 100% accurate are not for many reasons (the way the clinical trials were conducted) - seems it is more likely you get a false negative but it is also possible to get a false positive - so basically don't tell you much at all.i wonder if i did only have the virus mildly in that never had the temperature and sweats etc.but unfortunately for me it made it's way into my lung and whilst the aftermath of symptoms are very significant the actual virus was mild - god knows am making it up as i go along ..lol!",
          "theres just no answers is there.both my daughters friends one working at the nightingale the other at kings college hospital on reception both tested postive for antibodies but neither had any symptoms . x",
          "i did the abbot test and tested positive as did my husband who had mild symptoms for a few days, he lost his smell and taste though and that hasn't completely come back. a mystery why some will test positive and some negative",
          "that's interesting and good you both have antibodies. did you do the finger prick test or did you have blood taken in hospital?lx",
          "no rhyme or reason to any of it x",
          "had it done at work, gp came in to do for everyone. it was the abbot blood test, not finger prick. gp actually a friend who i have been in touch with to ask for help with symptoms, when she saw me there she said why are you here? you know you've had the virus. i told her i wanted to know if i had antibodies and she said all a positive test tells you is that you've def had it but it doesn't tell you what level of antibodies you have and it also doesn't tell you if you've recovered. found it all very confusing!",
          "how do we get susan on this page she is trying to find us gary",

          "the thread is just like \"sugar\" up and down !! lol yes she was on oxygen through a mask. her recovery is very much like ours up a down. no extra support now she's left hospital. i know one time the paramedics came and said i could go to hospital but it was better to stay at home like you said a fine line. i keep asking everyone i speak to if they know anyone who's had it just so i can find out what's happened to them regarding recovery. it makes you very inquisitive. xx",

          "thanks dawn, i probably will have a wee dram tomorrow just to see how it goes. funnily enough the first three weeks of this saga i slept like a baby, 8 or 9 hours straight, which is unheard of for me and i was having a drink just before bed. now i wake up some days sober but feeling like i have a hangover, so i'm not sure one drink to take the edge off can make me feel much worse. thanks for your opinion. hope you sleep well.",

          "morning everyone!someone has to police us gary we were literally all over the place last night! sorry you weren't good. i had good day thursday did a hilly 4.2 mile walk yesterday which normally helps clear chest but was really chesty and tight chest all night yesterday too. just posted a really interesting article but of course needs moderating (so bloody annoying)!! doctor/athlete saying about her recovery all our symptoms hope it pops up soon no answers really other than rest but makes you feel like you're not imaging it all and talks about all the set backs.on the alcohol issue ive drunk right through but only one glass and found it helps takes the edge off things for the evening - asked specialist and he seemed surprised i was even asking!! hope you get a better day gary and everyone at least sun shining so that helps!lx",

          "think that might be a different article - the one i linked that is still being moderated - it was in glamour magazine (it's all cultural reading round here \ud83d\ude02). ill look for this one though and have a read!i haven't touched coffee since a good few weeks ago when i literally though my heart was going to pop out my chest! i am on twinings pure peppermint tea - has no caffeine but has peppermint oil in it and helps lubricate the throat - it is my go to drink at the moment and definitely helps throat and settles stomach.don't want you all whoopin' it up tonight on my recommendation and then feeling cr&p tomorrow - might have to write another one of my disclaimers \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02have fun! stay positive, was thinking this morning about feeling rubbish yesterday afternoon and evening (breathing and chest tightness) but when i analysed it it was not nearly as bad as i have felt in the past so things are improving it is just very slow and hard to see. think back, remind yourselves of those truly awful days and nights and i think then you can see the real improvement. i hope you all feel same.lx",

          "stuart, i'd not let it get you down too much stuart after all we are only talking glamour magazine!! it's not an article from some high brow medical publication and was probably written by some intern who just made the whole thing up from bits and pieces she researched on internet!! probably logged on here and read everything we've said - i thought a lot of it sounded familiar \ud83d\ude02maciek i did ask my lung guy and he said mucus will gradually decrease and when chest becomes tight it is a build up of mucus which is exactly right for me. to be fair when i look back (yet again!) i think it has but it is so slow and as you say i have days where i literally think it is sorted and nope it is back - we need to be patient that is all we can do.lx",
          "please gary, no worries, i didn't need to read it, but i did. my fault. the other article seems more positive and it reminds me of an article posted on here ages ago about a guy in china who couldn't get rid of the virus and was given plasma to cure him. just hope they get on with it and it has positive results. thanks for that article \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

          "yes lulu, pretty much the same symptoms - tight chest, breathless, feeling of mucus. but i do have an irritating persistent cough. i have been in the sun too today and felt much better, as you say, i could actually have been normal! funnily enough when i go indoors i'm not so good with the breathing. that made me wonder if it's something in the house irritating me, but i can't think what. no carpets or anything like that. clean house. when we had lots of sun i had a pretty good period of sustained improvement and i don't know if its just coincidence but when the weather turned bad and i spent all my time indoors i went downhill. no idea if there is a link. perhaps the warmer outside air is good for the lungs?? i'm amazed you can do such long walks, it's fantastic. i used to be able to do them but now i am too cautious to try. if you think it's doing you good though without adverse affects then maybe carry on. i find that my body tells me pretty quick if i pushed it too far. anyway i hope you continue to have a good day. enjoy.",

          "oh amazing!! did we know about your sister? this might perk us all up! if you don't mind sharing did she have any underlying issues? did she have the breathing issues and mucus etc.? any other positive info about her recovery i think would help everyone so much.am so pleased she is well again, that is such good news xx",
          "really strange is not the word for this virus i've been fine all day today felt good no tightness or other symptoms other than dry mouth but i got that most of the time i am thinking of staying awake all night and hoping it's gone well i can pray can't i gary",
          "you could keep one eye open all night and see if it creeps up on you!! i know what you are saying we all seem to have had a better day today - is that coincidence or is it the weather? think stuart said he felt pretty good today too. let's hope tomorrow brings more of the same. just read an article in guardian which mentioned amongst other things than in a survey of 151 medical professionals who fell ill in march 68 are still unable to work, a further 26 went back only to have to take more time off so we are definitely not alone. i think the long recovery message is definitely getting out there.lx",
          "that's good lulu wish it would reach all our families rang my sister today said i was still ill said your joking told her i wasn't and gave her a couple of links to read i think she thought because i went back to work i was ok i'm not going back next week either i'm going to stay home till i'm ok gary",
          "she had the cough and fever aches etc breathlessness she was in bed like us for unwell for 5 weeks staying in no energy she started to slowly walk but couldn't go far as out of breath and always coughing, but slowly built up her stamina had a couple relapse diarrhea and then felt fluie again and tired, she kept drinking honey and lemon but her cough has only cleared up in last couple weeks and she says she feels back to normal.",
          "i know my brother the same - doesn't bother asking me any more and am sure he thinks it's been stress related due to my mum's sudden onset dementia which happened just before i became ill. i have been signed off for two more weeks - i feel need a couple of consistent weeks of feeling as well as i have today before i go back. the minute you are back everyone will forget how ill you have been and you will be in the thick of it again.hope it's a good night for you.lx",
          "yeah it's a tricky one if we do go back and have a setback that's not good i work on the railway so its dangerous as well so i gotta have my wits about me and with this virus it confuses me at times i can't think straight you have a good night too i'm going to try gary",
          "that's brilliant, such positive news that must be very encouraging for you to know that and also for all of us! glad she is feeling better now after all this time.lx",
          "she didn't get the breathlessness and tight chest for as long as us but the cough went on til last weekmy other sister had the same but she still gets the mucas and feels like something in her throat and my other sister had the tight chess etc like us and she runs everyday and couldn't do that. but we have thalassemia so our iron is low which also dosnt help, which she had come through on her blood test. but she recovered quickly, i was the worse one out the bunch and had the tight chest fir 6 weeks and breathing problems still. we all went to a christening at beginning of march and we all went down with flu like symptoms and bad coughs mine went for a couple weeks then bam couldn't breath really ill.",
          "i've felt better today as well walked over the field for a hour, made a curry, sat in garden, went to sainsburys, chatted to neighbour, stayed up instead of going to bed, i'm coming off the diazepam slowly so think that's effecting me as well.",

          "thanks",
          "@i read the article from ben lazarus just goes to show you they didn't have a clue back then i remember saying about matt hancock i couldn't believe that he was back after a week it's a shame we can't get a message to him tell him to help anyone who is still having the same issues now look at the gp saying i'm surprised you came here where you supposed to go watch a movie he even realised he could have infected others as well that's the one thing that scared me i was thinking all that time i was ill didn't realise it was out of my system well not completely still winding me up now \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "they are only just working it all out but from what i have read there is a lot of unreliability with the testing (swab and antibody) and a lot of research being done about t-cell response which would not show a positive antibody test result. i think if you have had this illness in any form other than the very mild version you know you do not need to have a test but whether you are protected against further infection no-one seems to know even if you have antibodies they do not think the protection lasts for more than 3 months same as normal cold/flu but i genuinely believe they do not really know yet - it is just too early.anyway off out now armed with hand gel, wipes, mask - nothing feels very normal about it but will be good to see my son.lx",
          "to tell you the truth lulu i have lost all trust in the whole system of this testing if they don't catch you as soon as you catch it you come up negative then you get a nurse who says they are not sure they work properly then the second or third time you go down to the hospital you get told were sure you've had it but you're in recovery then you get the virtual hospital doctor telling you we really don't know enough about this virus but we are learning then telling you your on the road to recovery at 6 weeks then the gp says its safe to go back to work with symptoms and i knew there will be problems with the antibodies testing roll on the vaccine how they going to get that right go and enjoy time with your son and get everything off your chest \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "interesting article. the most important bit for me was that the guy recovered! (pretty sure that's what it said)feeling washed out, little ones are arguing and i have no energy to get involved.have a video call appointment this evening with a naturopath who i'm told has helped a couple of people with the virus. this is not my style at all as only ever done conventional medicine but hey, that's not helping now...will let you all know how it goes!",
          "go for it you got nothing to lose can only gain must be hard with the kids mine are a bit older and are with their mum i've had a good day yesterday and so far today out of breath going to the shops but managed to get myself sorted now it's not right that you have to deal with it on your own told my sister i was still ill yesterday gave her a couple of links to read not heard from her since and we are close probably doesn't know what to say gary",
          "yes it can get difficult taking care of their needs when i can just about take care of my own...it's ok when my husband is around to help and not working...or when everyone is behaving! my oldest daughter is 12 and she's learnt to be really helpful and look after little ones when i can't, also doing some light cooking and baking.really important to get support from family or close friend (not just us virtual ones!) for a while didn't tell anyone what i was going through even my mum as didn't want them to worry but as it's dragged on have now told everyone and all been really supportive and trying to help, like this appointment this evening has been arranged by my husband's aunt! even if nothing comes out of it nice to know they care and i don't feel so alone in the struggle. it can be hard for family members to understand what you're going through but keep them in the loop anyway.",
          "where are you all now? loljust wanted to check in with good news...those h2 blockers...whether it be real or placebo, have really done the trick!chest tightness and cough has been significantly improved since the 3rd day of taking them..and i mean really noticeably improved.am kinda bummed they are being discontinued end of month now as i only found 2 packs i could buy. let's hope i don't need more than that though.been amazed at the difference though...7 days of antibiotics and chest was still tight as a drum, 4 days later and 3 days on the h2 blockers and, whilst i have the occasional cough, it's almost totally gone.hope you guys are all having a good weekend!",
          "res that's great!i have my contacts abroad trying to get hold of famotidine for me (no idea how or if they can ship it but we will find a way!)what brand did you try?",

          "just looked up i'm on lanzoprozole is that the same",

          "res,which h2 blockers are you taking and what symptoms have been relieved?jim.",
          "susan, lanzoprazole is different its a proton pump inhibitor. h2 blocker is usually sold otc and includes names like ranitidine, famotidine (aka pepcid ac). ranitidine has been discontinued over safety concerns and now there is a shortage of famotidine because people have been using it as an alternative to ranitidine.",
          "i have been using generic ranitidine.it's being discontinued end of month but i found 2 packs stashed at the back of the pharmacy shelf at an independent chemist so i bought them both and he gave me them half price as clearing them due to the discontinuation. he told me i couldn't get the other one unless have a prescription? i didn't realise pepcid was prescription only?",
          "hey jim,it's helped me with cough and tight chest.of course it may be placebo or just coincidence in terms of timing bit whatever it is i'll take it to have a few days without a constant tight chest and having away!",
          "generic ranitidine cause i couldn't get pepcid without prescription the pharmacist said.however ranitidine will be unavailable from the end of this month too due to safety concerns in long term use.i got the last 2 packs at my independent pharmacy and that was after looking in bigger pharmacies with no success.",
          "ok thank you",
          "i didn't realise either.but did they have it? not a problem to get your gp to prescribethought it's just not available",

          "ok thanks for explaining",
          "hey dane,i have been seeing a holistic doctor since last monday and i have really seen an improvement. chest pain doesn't come around as much. supplements include spm supreme (natural antiinflammatory) and k-force (vitamin d and vitamin k). this doc has had far more answers for me than the emergency room doctor and two mds i have seen. and i have been feeling better... can't argue with that! i still get lightheaded though. doctor was very concerned that i lost 30 lbs (about 14 kg?) in a month and i am likely to need some time to get my strength back, but at least i feel like i am finally going in the right direction with actual guidance other than \"stay home and rest\". i hope this new doctor helps you in the same way.",

          "yes, they have gary.i only found some in a small independent pharmacy that were still selling their last stock. maybe go somewhere small rather than the bigger pharmacies.",

          "hi all, had a really long talk with the holistic doc, she's put me on a strict diet and lots of supplements in quite high doses (quercetin, vitc, vit d, probiotic, zinc) and has told me not to budge from anything she's said (this is tailored for my specific needs and symptoms). need to do a new shop as half the things she said i can eat aren't in the house...no more wood and honey or any of the teas i have, just green tea, camomile, fennel, lemongrass are ok for me. she also said i need to take lanzoprazole which i was a bit surprised to hear being that she's holistic but she said i need to heal the acid before anything will work. this is going to be interesting....",
          "dane,sounds about the same as my experience, just no prescription. we got into the diet as well. only green tea. she took about 20 vials of blood from me to do \"just about every test possible\" and said she will use the results to see what i need to balance and strengthen myself so i never catch this again. it is supposedly a very thorough test. then again, she could be a vampire and thought i looked sweet. either way, i am looking forward to seeing what happens. this approach is totally new for me.",
          "hi lulu ,wow 9 miles ! impressed hope you feel ok tomorrow .glad you had a lovely time,i guess i'm lucky i still have one son at home ,at 18 and 6ft 2 he still gives a good hug bless him .yes i think i may be being optimistic about work but not ruling it out just yet but the last thing i want is to relapse.sleep well x",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've just had another good day and night hardly drank much water layed on my bed last night without my chest tightening first time normally have to be up straight so i'm going to go for a nine and i feel like lots of more positive people this morning feels like we are getting somewhere i'm glad you had a good walk with your son and your chest didn't tighten too much can see more high scores today i'm still a little tired but who isn't with the little sugar \ud83d\ude02 going to have a walk catch up with you all soon gary",
          "brilliant! really pleased gary seems things are definitely looking up! i'm going for 91/4 this week! ive definitely seen improvements this week with the cough and mucus am feeling more like myself but still not quite 100%right. my only symptoms are the cough mainly morning and evening but getting better, mucus and chest tightening. i only had one day last week weds which wasn't too good and for some reason friday afternoon/eve. my throat still looks red but has not been sore and doesn't feel as thick with mucus.hope everyone has seen improvements too this week. think me, gary and stuart are all on week 12? be good to hear from stuart too.walking then off to meet a friend later. i do think having other things to focus on helped last week. lx",
          "yeah i think i may have gone a bit higher if i didn't have them two days relapse but i am now hoping on getting somewhere this week got two weeks to sort out little sugar before going back to work will ring them today and see if all ok enjoy the sun and have a good day gary",
          "hi lulu and everyone! i was on the next page, then i see all these posts i missed !! \ud83d\ude02 i've been up and down over the weekend. felt fine one moment then experienced more chest tightness and coughing the next, especially in the evening. between 7 and 8 it always starts to get worse. this time last week i felt worse than now, so i have definitely improved but not to the levels i was experiencing when i had an 8 day period of feeling pretty good. i did have a little glass of bourbon over the weekend which gave me two good sleeps and a wonderful feeling of release and relaxation. amazing how alcohol can feel when you haven't had it for 10 weeks. i'm very interested in getting my hands on some h2 blockers as res mentioned. such a shame they are being removed from shelves, would you believe it? let's see how this week goes. friday will be week 13, i'm hoping it will be lucky for all of us. all the best everyone.",
          "haha! if she was a vampire sounds like she had a feast with all those vials! great you got to meet face to face that's the best and does sound very thorough. have to say gives you the feeling you're finally do something to help yourself, but man, the diet...gluten and dairy free...never done that before!week 13 for me today, giving myself 8.5 as still having muscle pain with activity, but feeling positive.off to hunt for supplements and lots of tofu and fruit. have a good day all!",
          "that sounds really interesting, dane, really hope it helps you. was she a particular type of holistic doctor?let us know how it goes",
          "hi everyonesome really good scores here :)i'm undecided at moment. i've had up and down week trying to get back to where i was before setback a couple of weeks or so ago. it's definitely better than the week before so i may go for 7 1/4had nice visit from daughter yesterday as she is in our social \"bubble\" as she lives alone.i looked for those h2 blockers and you can get them on ebay, from america and taking several weeks to come! hopefully by then we won't need them??have a good day everyone",
          "she works alongside conventional medicine and focuses a lot on diet but deals with homeopathic remedies as well...if that helps...it's all new to me and not going to pretend i understand it all!",
          "morning stuart i know that amazon do a powerful anti acid and reflux tablet they may work if you can't get the h 2 blockers might be worth a try gary",
          "try the ones from amazon they might work till you get the h 2 blockers joanne have a look gary",
          "hi gary, i think it has to contain particular medication to help with our symptoms, like famotidine. i have a supply of lanzaprole and omeprazole already so i'm good for stopping any acid problems but i think the h2 blockers have something that specifically affects the virus in theory. hopefully. what are they called, the ones you saw on amazon?",
          "oh ok i don't suffer too much with it on amazon they got a powerful anti acid and reflux tablet different flavours obviously not what everyone needs what about the famotidine is it not available on google gary",
          "hi gary, no luck finding any so far although ebay has various others like ranitidine but i'm a bit dubious about buying meds from ebay.",
          "hello res, what dosage are you taking?",
          "ok stuart don't know what else to suggest i've just ordered some more turmeric powder the tea seems to have been working and the flarin so going to try a organic turmeric powder see if they can finish the job then try and get the tightness sorted gary",

          "ah thanks, what strength are they, 75mg? and do you take them together or at different times?",
          "stuart,you'll be able to get pepcid ac tablets on prescription from your doctor.hooe your well and everyone else too,jim.",
          "75mg yes, but jim's right, if you can get the pepcid instead on prescription would try for that as that's the one from the study.",
          "hi jim, i spoke to my doc who said she couldn't prescribe famotidine or ranitidine for me as they don't have a proven link. plus they can't get ranitidine. i told her how frustrating it was that something so simple wasn't able to be given to me to at least try. when i told her i would be forced to buy stuff off ebay she said she'd speak to her colleagues. so let's see if she gets back to me. hope you get better luck with your doc. all the best jim, hope you're doing okay today.",
          "thanks res, see my reply to jim \u263a\ufe0f",
          "stuart, that's what my gp said when i asked about famotidine, didn't understand the problem, i'm anyway suffering from acid reflux but she said same, no proven link...don't get it.just got a call from the post covid hub, nurse spoke to me for a long while, very nice and suggested i go to various site pages for tips about my issues. also said i should volunteer for patient research as my symptoms aren't classic respiratory. might do that but happen to be having a bit of a difficult day so will have to wait. day 1 of new diet not great, not feeling well enough to prepare veg laden lunch....hope everyone having better day.",
          "hello dane, how frustrating. was that since res posted that you tried to get hold of some or at an earlier time? i understand that their prescriptions have to follow guidelines but as you suffer from acid reflux i don't see why they can't put it as that and let you try it. let's see whether i get a bit of luck after she has spoken about it with her colleagues. at least it wasn't a solid 'no'.i like the idea of volunteering. i am still waiting for my call from the hub. did they give you a number to call or website? good luck with the new diet. 5 weeks ago i switched to eating fruit for brekky and a huge salad of raw vegetables and salad stuff for lunch. i've been loving it, surprisingly, which tells me my body wanted it as it certainly wasn't my usual diet. anyway i hope it works out for you. it has to be worth a try.",
          "hi stuart and dane the hub will probably be ringing you soon stuart she rang me lovely nurse mickey mouse she called herself went through quite a bit with me and then told me to help with my breathing go to asthma uk it will tell you how to deal with it etc so i came back to tell you i'm going to have a read through see if i can sort out this tight chest gary",
          "cheers gary, i'll keep an eye out for the call and take a look at the website. have a good day.",
          "asthma uk for the breathing breathlessness ask the nurses to help you find the way through i'm useless when it comes to things like that think the rest of my day will be sussing it out gary i had to tell her that this virus makes me forget things she knows so she helped me get to the breathing exercises",
          "nice one gary, thank you.",
          "think it was just over a week ago, been on the case with the famotidine since i heard they were trialling it for covid in the us which was in the news 2 weeks ago.hope you have better luck with your gp.nurse at the hub told me its on their website. you go to research and there should be a sub heading for patients in research or something similar, haven't checked yet. go for it!def got a load of fruit and veg now in the diet, great it works for you, hope it works for me!today's (late) lunch is broccoli, courgette, butternut squash, carrot and tofu baked in the oven with a bit of soy sauce on top, waiting eagerly for it to be ready :)",
          "lulu and i can't remember who else it was who got a negative antibody test, the daily telegraph have an article today about how you can fight the virus with t cells and doesn't put you in a vulnerable position for reinfection. haven't read the full article but thought it would be of interest to you.",
          "hi stuart, i'll update you and everyone else when i've been and put it too him.he'll find it difficult to say no after the conversation we had last week. however, as we all know now certain medicines don't mix and that's why i haven't taken ibuprofen.thank you for asking after me, today's been okay in the great scheme if things. knackered doing anything, lump in throat, reverberations and mucus but other than that i'm tickety boo.oh, i bought a peak flow meter from an online shop that's runs the world. just played with it. my rate is right for sex, age and height?jim.",
          "that was me. positive covid test, negative antibody test a month later. doc said some young folks are not building the immunity.",
          "so if you can, read the article. they are aware people don't show antibodies which means you fought off infection with t cells. sounds like the the t cells being able to fight infection puts you in a better position and they are investigating how this works with this virus for vaccines.",
          "hi jim and everyone. jim i know we're on similar timescale with this and just wanted to check if you've been feeling more knackered than usual ? i know i have and it's so disheartening , just want to start feeling normal again !! i've got the internal shakes on and off not frequent and the dreaded mucus like you. i've also got swollen glands. breathing hasn't been too bad though.",
          "gary,i've just been through those exercises via the asthma uk site, which are worth doing but they not full expansion of the chest.i was told, so this is untested that we needed to fully expand out lungs to prevent blockages especially in the lower lungs that aren't used when sitting and lying down. theres a doctor on youtube via a bbc interview that gives advice on the exercise to help this.another point, i bought an acapella breath device from the usual place and i think it's helping mucus removal. in saying that i've only used it a couple of days.thanks gary,jim.",
          "hi steph,lovely to hear from you!i concur with all of your post barring the glands.i tire at doing the slightest of things and i know when i have as my right nostril becomes inflamed! yikes, you couldn't write it.the shakes really get to me, as i wake up numerous times through the night and i can feel them. they usually stop around lunchtime though. oh high bp.try an acapella breath device from a. zon i've used for a couple of days and i think helps.i know what you mean about being fed up it's dragging on. i'm sick of it excuse the pun.jim.",
          "thanks for info about holistic doctor, danehope you enjoyed your lunch, sounds lovely. i'm sure all that hard work will be worth it",
          "hi jim. i hope you get some joy with your doc. i haven't heard back from mine so i presume the answer was no to a prescription. currently asking a friend in spain if they sell famotidine otc. i know it might be a long shot but i'm getting desperate.i feel like i'm not that far from being well, it's just that i can't get the intruder out the door completely. i really feel like i have 'something' in my system that shouldn't be there. maybe that sounds mad but it feels like i have an unwelcome secret resident. anyway jim it's good that the peak flow meter showed you are normal, is that the same as this acapella device you mentioned?",
          "hi allbit late in the day for my scoring but i'm going with a cautious 8...hoping it's not the lull before the storm but generally had a much better week than last week.still with a few blips ,ups and downs but feeling much more positive.glad to read some other good scores going in the right direction .had such a lovely day seeing my daughters and grandsons,so emotional. thanks for the info gary glad you had a good night last night .happy that the little drink helped with your sleep too stuart.great score lulu so pleased to hear .fingers crossed that the diet works for you dane,i'm so much more aware of what i'm eating now not sure i could stick to something quite so strict myself but i really hope you feel some improvement from it ...i did have some tofu today though \ud83d\ude02,one of my daughters is vegan and she gives me plenty of advice on nutrition and healthy eating and arrived with a box of posh peppermint tea and vitamins ,my other daughter brought chocolates. ..both welcome \ud83d\ude0ahope you all a lovely evening everyone x",
          "stuart,the peak flow is a clemment and wright as per nhs fir measuring max flow rate.acapella device is a pep device that you blow in and it shakes the breath down into your lungs to loosen the mucus.i agree with the feeling like theres an intruder i wished they'd crack on and find something thatll sort it.good to talk to you.jim.",
          "hi jimsorry things aren't too good for you. just wondering about your breathing device. is it easy to use? i've got one from amazon but i haven't got it out of the box yet! i've looked at the instruction manual though",
          "thanks jim, i'll take a look. speak soon.",
          "wow the telegraph article is so interesting and hopeful. the bit saying they tested people who had the strikingly similar coronavirus sars back in 2003 and the t cells generated back then are still active 17 years on and secondly those old t cells offer protection against the new coronavirus. such good news as there is no doubt i have had it so felt really confused as to why no antibodies - the specialist can see the residue and damage in lung which is consistent with having c-19. seems if your tcells fight it off you may have better protection than just having antibodies but no imminent test for tcells.glad everyone doing ok - worth trying alternative methods think there is a lot to be said for diet and supplements.glad the hub are getting back to people too and are helpful.have a good evening.lx",
          "ok jim thanks i will check that one out the nurse from the hub put me into the asthma uk one gary",

          "stuart, you've hit the nail on the head on describing what we have !! we've got an unwelcome squatter who doesn't want to move out !! it's reaping untold havoc and consuming us. jim thanks for advice about breathing device , if i get no joy through steam inhalation i'll get one too. sorry everyone for not scoring just don't feel much improvement atm.",
          "jim i'm so happy that your day included a bit of sucking and blowing with positive results, long may it continue \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude02by the way i got my call from the hub this afternoon too. i'm sure they'll come to you very soon.",
          "just need to find a way of kicking the ****** out steph! i've had him/her near the door a few times but they always manage to get back in. hope you have a good evening.",
          "stuart,indeed my friend, i can't remember the last time i laughed, which i did writing that.stuart just adding the breathing exercises you let me and others know about for those who have just joined.guys,if you use the old search engine with the below it'll describe three exercises for helping the old lungs.lung health institute - how to increase lung capacity.jim.",
          "thanks jim, sounds fun, looking forward to it :)",

          "brilliant dawn 8!! so glad you have had a better week and yes i think still have a few blips i am the same but it is generally feeling more like old self physically and mentally. so lovely that you got to spend time with daughters and grandsons too that is a real pick me up.i've had a pretty good day after the 9 mile walk - was a bit worried! walked 3.2 hilly this morning in forest then met an old school friend for a sit in park with a small bottle of prosecco - am rattling through the small bottles of prosecco at the moment \ud83d\ude09 have to say now doing more during the day am feeling a bit tired in the evening but love being busy again so probably just have to get a balance and maybe have a day of not doing so much in between.i'm a bit lost on all the gadgets you guys are talking about but hope they help. for me the mucus is always bad in the morning and evening - no idea why but it is!lx",
          "hi lulu, glad to hear the the 9 miles didn't set you back today was a bit worried when i read that yesterday .its nice to feel tired when you know you've kind of earned it though.you'll need the the full size bottles soon lulu \ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udd42 \ud83d\ude02yep bit lost with the gadgets too....thought i was on the wrong site for a bit with jim's comments \ud83d\ude02 but hope they help.x",

          "thanks dawn, really want to get back to normal even missing work !! i've been googling swollen glands which i know isn't good as my mind's gone into over drive. it's like one thing gets better and this little \"sugar\" throws something else into the mix !! normally with illnesses tiredness and other things gets better over the weeks but with this it lulls you into a false sense of security. it's the little \"sugar\" that keeps giving !!hope you're having a good evening xx",
          "lol - yep thought i was on the wrong page again when i read what jim had been up to today, thought blimey things are looking up \ud83d\ude02 actually really hope things are looking up jim - it's been such a tough time for you.hope things move on for you steph - it's so disheartening when you feel things aren't progressing but most of us have had weeks like that and still get them. i have that weird vibrating thing bit like someone has left an engine running - what on earth is that about??!!ruffio - definitely read the telegraph article dane mentions about tcells it's really interesting - and might be more reliable than the last article i posted at weekend from glamour magazine \ud83d\ude02my throat bit sore tonight it could be:a) talking too much \ud83d\ude33b) sitting on the grass (hay fever affecting these hyper sensitive lungs i have now acquired)c) not drinking enough water as nowhere to have a pee in the middle of a fieldd) basically totally overdoing it last few days who knows? scored 91/4 and even at this stage still have plenty of choice from the pick n' mix selection of symptoms!lx",
          "hi lulu, you do make me laugh....yes you've described the vibrating thing so right, what's that about ?? the antibodies article is interesting. so taking the test is not so cut and dry to prove whether or not you have any. i've started drinking apple cider vinegar with water for my throat and mucus giving everything a go !! enjoy your evening xxx",
          "eugh.. apple cider vinegar and water that sounds tough but if it works why not?! let me know if you think any improvement i may join you!lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone came back and stuck me on my back side yesterday sweats came back and earache last night fatigue oh well gotta get back up again your never gonna keep me down day of rest meeting my daughter for her break try and be positive hope you all had a good night gary",
          "hi stuart what's the hub?",

          "hi jim do you have asthma?",
          "morning! thought you were over the sweats and wonder why the ear ache has cropped up? you don't think it is something different like an ear infection and not linked to this? trouble is hard to know what's what and assume everything is linked to this. glad seeing your daughter and also think need rest days in between so try and take it easy today. we know there are blips and my throat was sore again last night think that is a sign i've overdone it one way or another.am off to see mum again so glad weather good otherwise couldn't do these garden visits then it is prosecco on the green tuesday - blimey that comes round fast another week gone!hooe everyone is on track today and you feel better later gary - it will pass.lx",
          "gary,big virtual hug from me pal.your chins up jeep going!jim.",
          "morning susan,no i don't have asthma.why?jim.",
          "as your doing the peak flow chart or are they suggesting this for our breathing situation and mucas",
          "that's great news susan sounds like things really improving for you am so pleased! is it just slices of lemon or squeezed lemon in hot water? keep meaning to try this.you can google covid hub and there is a support number and nurse will call you.enjoy your day and so good back to your knitting!lx",
          "yes i know just got conjunctivitis as well i think my eyes are red i will battle on another day tomorrow will see my daughter and rest the earache comes and goes i had it bad about 6 weeks ago so it's part of the virus due some good ones enjoy seeing your mum and prosecco tuesday gary",
          "thanks jim will keep battling gary",
          "i wanted to know everything i could regarding lung function and if there was a reduction in capabilities. however, not knowing my previous statistics it is hard to gauge, so i am working against the predicted results for age, sex and height.we shouldn't really have to be doing all this and it should have been done by a medical professional but i feel let down by the system (not the people within the nhs).i've asked to have a ctscan, further xrays, see a respiratory specialist and/or physio all to no gain.even simple tests as per peak flow/spirometer tests i've been told are not being done as there is too much risk to staff involved. i do understand that however there are numerous means of communication these days and therr is now ppe. we fo not live in the 70/80 or 90's there's the internet, skype, facetime etc.sorry off the soap box.regards,jim.",
          "sorry missed that question, i am charting the results. oops.",
          "ok i know it's sad we have to look into different ways of helping ourselves, i would have thought as the numbers come down they might be able to us all abit more, with proper checks ct scans etc as we were not hospitalised but all have been very ill.",
          "you can use either lulu but it has to be in warm water. oh ok i never knew about the hub handy to know.",
          "also lulu the lemon drink is good for your immune system.",
          "hi susan, it's the post covid hub. it's been set up by asthma uk i think. if you search for post covid hub you should find them easily enough. give them a call, they are trying to get as much info from people as possible about our symptoms.",
          "ok stuart thanks i'll look it up",
          "thanks susan right at the very beginning my gp told me to drink neat lemon juice which i did for several weeks then started adding a fresh orange so now i have i orange and 1 lemon squeezed daily - but i will try your suggestion too.jim, i feel same when specialist was phoning me for consultations i had all my vitals which i had documented every day for few weeks - oxygen level, heart rate, blood pressure etc. and i was thinking what if you didn't have the money (to buy oximeter, blood pressure monitor etc) or know how to do this - we have literally had no support it is really bad. when i asked for my repeat prescription for mucodyne the receptionist said i've asked the doctor and he said \"if you are not feeling well give him a ring\" - so funny... felt like saying \"well about two months two late and how about him giving me a ring knowing what he diagnosed me with and how long i've been ill\"! i think they think well she is still here so must be ok - no idea how much we have all suffered it is definitely a case of if you didn't die you are ok there is nothing in between. my friend who's cousin was hospitalised has had the same - no support since coming home just struggling on with recovery on his own.lx",
          "yes definitely sounds like it is - i am enjoying the tinnitus that i acquired with this - don't notice it during the day but always at night.yep sending you positive thoughts gary, hope you pick up today you do normally manage to bounce back so \ud83e\udd1elx",
          "yes thank you lulu i will try and get on with it tomorrows another day gary",
          "i add spoon of honey to it and it is delicious. tastes almost like cider ;)",
          "guys,the post covid hub have called me, gone through the whole sorry story and said i am one of many.i gave her a blow by blow account from the end of march including all the symptoms and treatments, medical interventions and exercises etc.she wasn't impressed when i explained an ambulance never turned up but received a telephone call four hours later etc.genuinely surprised i hadn't been hospitalised but as i said you had to be at the brink.the prognosis was 6-12month recovery and to keep up contacting doctors, taking sats, eating small meals but often, breathing exercises and gentle exercise but not going too far to cause a relapse.the offer was there for assistance with claiming benefits once on sick pay etc, as they have an expert. if you call and ask they will ring back and help anyone through the system.jim.",
          "sue,can you make the lemon drink with jiff lemon concentrate and hot water?",
          "thanks for sharing jim - did you find it reassuring talking to her? it just seems there is no answer other than time and getting balance between exercise and rest. 6>12 months seems to be the timescale people are now talking about.lx",
          "advised recovery time seems to be getting longer and longer 6-12 months is ages.thanks for sharing your conversation details with us jim.i'm sure the nhs will get on to cases like us eventually but please g-d we should all recover fully before that!feeling heavy on the chest and back today, hopefully it will go if i take it easy.had papaya for breafast today (according to new diet...along with blueberries and rice krispies in rice milk) and my lips started itching about half an hour after, they're still feeling a bit sore and itchy 3 hours later....weird.a family member who lives abroad has managed to get famotidine, now have to figure out how it will get here!",
          "lulu,well, hard to say i've been reassured. however, she was very friendly, helpful but the timescales, guess work.as she said no one knows much about it.without bringing anyone down and being realistic, on the first ambulance attendance at my home they said get past day ten, thats critical,next time a doctor said 4 weeks, the next 6 weeks.as time goes on they just extend the timeline, as per the bbc article today about the twenty year old who is in the same boat as us. they estimate 6 months.if it is 6 months, it is. i wish they could put a time on it, as do we all.i am off to the quacks later, do i'll update ref their thoughts etc.have a good day,jim.ps one thing she stressed was not to over do it but not be stagnant due to blood clots etc. yikes!!",
          "hi everyone, thanks for feeding back jim. it must've been quite emotional describing what you've been through and still going through. thanks to you all i've just made a call to the hub and will await their call. just sitting and waiting it out like our gp's say isn't good enough !! yes news article mentions longer recovery for some, hopefully we get more help soon. good luck at the doctors.",
          "steph,hope your alright \"timeline buddy\".my emotions have changed over the past few days and i am becoming increasingly angry by how our cohort has been treated.there was an interesting news interview with a doctor on the lunchtime news who has trialled a well known and vastly used steroid, which from tomorrow they are rolling out to all hospitals around the country, as there is no need to test its safety. they described it as helping the poor individuals on air or ventilation, however it must be some form of anti inflammatory.if it is we might get a chance to have it.fingers crossed.jim.",
          "hi jim, i'm ok think we've got to be, as sinking into depression won't help our situation. my brother sent me article a out trials and you never know our gp's might suggest next time we speak with them or pigs might fly !!!",
          "hello everyone \ud83d\ude4bfinally found you all again \ud83d\ude03. just want to ask if anyone experienced heart palpitations..... i've been doing ok for a few weeks , breathing not so bad and suddenly this little sugar throws a new one at me \ud83d\ude31. it started on saturday morning and it felt like heart coming out of my mouth . so phoned gp and had a ecg today and some blood test ...finally!!! i will know results probably on thursday . hope everyone is having a good week . diane",
          "hi steph,which trial any more details?just arrived home from the doctors. bloods taken, x-ray ordered as crackling on right lower lung. he wasn't concerned over it but in saying that it isn't his lung.changed my bp meds, sleeping tablets given wouldn't give h2 blockers.his prognosis if this travels in line with other post viral fatigue disorders is a 12 months recovery. i asked if he thought i'd be back at work within 6 months and he doubts it.his main advice was not to over do anything to cause symptoms otherwise it's a backward step. happy days, jim.",
          "hi jim yes you can i use both and use warm water from the kettle.",
          "hi diane yes we all have had the fast heart beats all through this virus",
          "hey jim and steph,yes the mental game is real. i am probably about a 7/10 physically, but mentally i am probably at about a 5/10 or worse. after going through all of this, i probably overanalyze every little tick or movement in my body that just a few months ago would never get a second thought. it is so easy to say \"well just get over it\". i have always been mentally tough but i guess now i know what people are talking about.",
          "hi jim i think you should have been hospitalised as you were and still are poorly and be on observation ward for a bit \ud83d\ude18",
          "hi rufio,thanks for that, appreciated.how long have you been suffering? when you say 7/10 physically. does that refer to being back to normal?im week ten and cant physically do much of anything except wash and go upstairs a few times.jim.",
          "sue,i should have been in originally but they never saw me.now its you can cope at home with help from your wife etc.i'll get there though.jim.",
          "jim,it has been about 13 weeks since i first felt a symptom and about 9-10 weeks since the absolutely miserable period. yes 7/10 physically with 10 being 100% better means well enough to walk the dog one or two times a day for 15-20 mins, but then need to take it easy. i can only hold a conversation for a few minutes before i get really tired. it is probably mostly mental, as i said, because every little muscle twitch or sudden small headache makes me want to cease all physical exertion immediately, but my body can probably handle it if i let it. current events in the usa certainly do not help the mental state. i know the physical beating i took is still there and am sure the extreme weight loss has something to do with it. i think i just need to build myself back up again. we have come a long way over the last few months, and remembering that usually helps.",
          "thank you.",
          "hi jim it's the same trial same steroid but don't think it's going to work for us just as i'm just listening to daily corona update and they mentioned it !! i'm glad your gp is arranging further tests the more they check us out the better. i've just spoken to the lovely post covid hub nurse. so nice to have someone listen and not cut you off. she directed me to breathing exercises you previously mentioned. she mentioned lots of people with tiredness , breathing problems at our timescale. not with swollen glands though so we had a chuckle about that. she also said to keep speaking to doctor if anything new happens.",
          "hi diane,same here! i spoke to doctor today on phone to order some more heartburn medication (no, i can't have h2 blockers) and i mentioned that my heart rate had been really high. he suggested ecg so i've just been and had one and i'll get the results in a few days.good luck, but it does seem to be a common symptom even though it's scary when it happens. all the best :)",
          "hi rufio all this has knocked my confidence. never suffered from mental health issues, but i am now with anxiety. hopefully we all get through this without any long term issues. diane, yes i've had palpitations and irregular heart beat. pulse has been fast and had high blood pressure but it seems ok now.",
          "6-12 months!!! noooi do feel though that as we slowly get better physically, there's definitely going to be the mental side to recover from as it has really been a traumatic experience for us.i'm worn out with googling stuff, buying stuff, then finding out that if you're taking one thing then you can't take others. and all the stuff i was taking for sore throat, phlegm etc, most of it is no good if you've got acid reflux! eek",
          "hi jim, thanks for the update. sounds like you got a great call from the covid hub, i didn't get anything like the info you got from your call. no info about time scale, nothing about benefits or day to day procedures. guess it depends who you get. must admit, the 6 - 12 months thing is a bit crushing, it will ruin my work if that's the case. i'm going to choose not to accept that! as you've said, it's guess work really. it's great that you have actually been seen by a doc. mine won't see me, even now. wouldn't even allow me there to test my breathing to see if the inhalers they prescribed me were even necessary. i'm pretty angry about it all. 12 weeks and not a single examination or call from my gp to check on me. to annoy me further they have been happy to prescribe inhalers and antibiotics without a single clue as to whether i actually need them, but when i ask for the h2 blocker it's a \"no\". i know it's a long shot anyway but the lack of care just gets me so mad. i feel like they just want me to go away and not bother them. i did get exercises from the respiratory nurse and an xray but it's been the bare minimum. anyway, rant over, sorry everyone, just feel a bit frustrated \ud83d\ude16really hope you're all having a better day. ps thanks for the pm's jim. will be in touch.",
          "think we're all feeling the same as you with the whole get on with it on your own.",
          "bless you jim you will, in fact we all will and we're all be laughing about how bad we all were in a few months time.",
          "yes susan, everyone's in the same situation. i feel a bit silly complaining really. i have had it easy compared to some.",
          "good evening everyone don't worry about complaining stuart i did this morning had a better day can feel the tight chest but that goes with the territory now hoping for a better night tonight seems like a lot happening today i've given up with my gp they just fob me off mention covid 19 think the phone starts sweating in the receptionists hand and then she says hold on i'm trying to find a doctor available can't be that busy no one in there and when they do answer they google it rant over hope everyone has a good evening gary",
          "this is the perfect place to rant...no one can stop you :)i've also got increased anxiety. read an interesting article from a psychologist about dealing with some kind of panic disorder, found the exercises she suggested helpful even for mild anxiety.it goes like this; you need to identify something that you really enjoy, it could be the view from your window, could be something you have experienced like a holiday...anything. then you try to experience it as much as you can with your senses and feel in the moment eg. holiday on the beach, you try to remember the feel of the sand, smell of the sea etc. it's supposed to calm things down for you. my go to relaxation is eating a magnum ice cream (just imagine it cos not allowed now!)...i know, not very deep and meaningful :) but seems to work for me!",
          "no your not stuart were all fed up with no answers",
          "a magnum ice-cream go girl yeah gotta give that a go i'll go with my mate getting married on the beach in canada or scarlet johanson eating your magnum \ud83d\ude02 or with the kids at durdle door last year good idea gary got me thinking now",

          "your welcome stuart you have a good one as well gary",
          "hi dane, that's all really nice advice. i just did a similar thing while i went for a walk in the field. beautiful evening sunshine here, and while i walked i remembered some happy times with my favourite person. it certainly helps one's mood. must say, that magnum sounds mighty tempting.... \ud83d\ude00hope you have a good evening.",
          "it's all about the food (read: chocolate) for me now since i've started this diet!again, works for me. even think of it while i try to get to sleep",
          "i am not surprised at the time scale as specialist pretty much said the same to me - first time i spoke to him he said another 6/8 weeks which would have taken me to 4 months but when he had seen my ct scan he said 6/12 months. the only thing i would say is that might be the time to \"fully\" recover but things will be slowly improving all the time en route to full recovery and when you get to a certain point feeling a lot better than you currently do you will hopefully be able to start doing more of the things you enjoy, get out and about more and the anxiety will gradually lessen. i agree with the balance of rest/exercise - i definitely don't think sitting around too much is good - it makes my chest much worse, think need to keep moving even if just pottering around at home.hope everyone has a good evening.lx",
          "great advice and do this in yoga to relax.we will all go to sleep tonight dreaming of magnum ice creams - i'm going for the almond variety and definitely a full size one not a mini one \ud83d\ude02lx",

          "morning!that doesn't sound too good gary ive seen others mention conjunctivitis but not been affected in this way. hope it improves during the day and you pick up - sorry to hear the magnum and scarlet didn't help!feeling quite chesty - decided it is either because i do not do my walk on a tuesday as it is prosecco on the green day or whether it is because i talk for around 4 hours non stop. i had a chesty day last weds and have a feeling heading same way today. i personally think it is not doing the walk on a tues - i feel the walking keeps the mucus from settling so much on chest - very depressing when you feel it is improving and i suppose it is but still there and still causing problems.lots of articles floating around now about recovery time and a guy on twitter saying good news about this new drug which helps people in hospital but what about all the people still suffering at home with no support. also google: \"shocking\" nearly all who recovered from covid-19 have health issues months later it is in the nl times (netherlands). very interesting not too depressing just a representation of people like us.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've been back on to the gp waste of time going to send a prescription through to my chemist for the earache i asked her for an mri scan for my lungs no was basically her reply so i got on to work and asked them my supervisor said give vallidium a call to help with my mental health nice lady thought i was ok bless her my work said would ring me soon think they must mean the weekend well i've put the ball in their court now see what happens besides that i'm having a good day gary",
          "just read that article it's true its happened in holland now it is happening here so like we all know we have been left to get on with it and most of our gps bosses are probably aware of things like this but because they are not feeling what is happening to us same let them get on with it gary going to have to try and be positive and strengthen now still have to manage it and try to not over do it gary",
          "well it's good you have prescription for ear infection hopefully it will clear up quickly. i honestly think they don't know what to prescribe as all these symptoms we have are the aftermath of covid and it seems there are some common symptom i.e. breathing, chest and then there are specific ones which are slightly different for everyone - some days i feel worried that my chest will never clear but i have to be positive and looking back it is so much better than 4 weeks ago so logically that tells me it will continue to improve but i definitely still have my low moments as it is so slow.just done 4 mile walk with friend and she said you look absolutely fine now, you seem better, have put on a bit of weight etc. etc. and i was thinking yep that is all great but as soon as i get home i will have to cough up all the mucus and again later tonight do the same, my chest will feel tight and will have pains in my lungs but the problem is no-one can see how badly you are still affected and as we have said most people have lost interest and every time someone asks you how you are you can't say \"well i'm much better but still have breathing issues and coughing, and mucus and tinnitus and ....and....and...\" it is so tricky because you feel you need to tell people otherwise it is just assumed you are fine!hope your work medical are more supportive. i think my walking friend is my mental health support she listens to me but i'm aware it must be boring so am trying to talk about other stuff now!lx",

          "definitely not an easy job susan. better make sure you are 100%.",
          "yes i did - my son in la recommended it and i read it when i was at my worst and it was definitely a turning point for me mentally - i appreciate won't be for everyone but he is a firm believer in how powerful the mind is and talked me into reading it! he kept saying to me you have to get on top of the anxiety before you can recover as at that stage i wasn't sleeping because of the anxiety - i was too scared to go to sleep - god seems like a lifetime ago but only about 7 weeks!glass of wine and chocolate has perked me up a bit!enjoy evening.lx",

          "morning all, had a bit of a restless night. woke up with sore throat, havent had that since 9th march!i find the fb group is all doom and gloom much prefer this group at least we can also humour ourselves through it, much more helpful.gary you mentioned not losing taste and smell, did anyone on this group lose theirs at any point? it's the one symptom that doesn't seem to have affected us 'long haulers' maybe those who had that recovered quicker?",
          "morning dane not the sore throat return i've had that a long time but only comes back now when i talk too much its been okay last couple days so must be due a visit i've been trying to get a ct scan one of the hospitals said i need a gp or a consultant referral already asked my gp for one said no we are up against it when you're ill gary",
          "hey gary,i know you've had it tough with the sore throats, hope it's gone for good for you.i also feel my throat dry up when i talk too much, it's sort of a tired feel, feel it especially in the late evening. today is proper sore throat just another symptom in the bucket.good luck trying to get a ct, have you tried speaking to another gp at the same practise? might have better luck with someone other than your gp. i've spoken to 3 at my practise, they sometimes differ in opinions.",
          "mine are useless i always get put through to the same one i didn't realise how bad they were till i googled it i will try other options if i have to get her to help then i will i've asked a couple of friends who are trying to find out what they can do gary",
          "sounds like we have a mixed bag this morning! sore throats, ear ache - i can join the sore throat brigade again definitely think as garry and dane say it is caused by talking too much and not drinking enough (water that is!). felt really rough yesterday and tuesday talked solidly for four hours (i know..!!), drank prosecco and very little water as nowhere to pee. also sat for too long without moving around. i have learnt yet another valuable lesson when you feel better don't do 9 mile walks, don't go out every day, don't think you are over it, don't talk with your mates for 4 hours solid and make sure you still get plenty of rest.i think it is the inflammation i feel like i need \"oiling\" everything feels dry and raspy and unless keep drinking throat gets sore - i can still see the inflammation in throat anyone else looked down their throat with a magnifying mirror - mine is bright red has been since the start - goes off a bit during day but by bed time it is really inflamed again. i haven't lost sense of tast dane, had metallic taste at beginning and have the weird bald patch on my tongue where the taste buds seem to have disappeared.hope people can get ct scans sorted - it is i think the clearest picture of what is going on in lungs - just had my invoice, the consultation and ct scan was 850 quid (in case anyone thinking of paying privately which for some might be an option i don't know).anyway, taking it easy today and hoping pick up again before the weekend.have a good day everyone.lx",
          "morning lulu i didn't really think about that looking down my throat guess it does not help drinking and talking too much women when they get together lol i'm relaxing today and meeting my daughter when she finishes work will start walking again tomorrow not going to push it though i suppose we have to try to work out a pattern of not upset it or perhaps it just says i'll let you have it today i can't work it out that's a lot of money for a ct scan i will still try and get one sorted gary",
          "hi lulu, i think not overdoing it when you feel well is an important point. i was told by the respiratory nurse that exercise was important but to not do too much and to do it on alternate days with a rest day in between. she also said to continue with lung exercises to build up lung capacity. i too get knackered from chatting. i would never have thought i could be so affected just by talking to someone for 20 minutes. i had a good day yesterday, almost normal, but when i went to bed the breathing difficulty started again. chest aches today, which is a tad disappointing. completely understand you when you talk about feeling dry. i feel like i'm breathing through dust sometimes. week 13 tomorrow. yayyyyy!! hope you and everyone have a better day today. best wishes.",

          "it definitely is stuart - i am one of those people who never learn - every time i over do it i think i am not going to do that again and then do exactly the same thing a week later! i think the rest day in between is key - i think i'd put my lungs under too much pressure and were inflamed again yesterday and last night. yep i feel like breathing through cotton wool - it's such an awful feeling. started feeling a bit weepy and angry last night it just seems so unfair - don't get me wrong i know it could have been so much worse but it could have also been so much better and we didn't catch this awful virus and spend all this time struggling through trying to recover without any proper support. on top of that my antibody test came back negative so now people say \"ohh so you didn't have it after all\" then i feel the need to go into a big explanation of how ill i've been and what else could it be and just because no antibodies doesn't mean you haven't had it blah blah blah....have you heard of tcells... blah blah ... also the tests are not accurate blah blah .. to hear \"well my neighbours sister's husband's daughter's boyfriend had the test and she was positive \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 it's so boring!! at least if i'd had antibodies people would just accept it and that would be that.lx",
          "yep in case you hadn't gathered i can talk for england and so can most of my friends!! take it easy and enjoy seeing your daughter. it is a lot of money and you shouldn't have to pay so hopefully your doc will sort out but think they try and fob you off with an x-ray for as long as they possibly can so you will need to be persistent - make that phone receiver sweat in her hand \ud83d\ude02",
          "she's already said no lulu i'm thinking even if i do have it done its not going to change anything at this later stage so i feel i will just go with the flow and try to get back to normal that's what they call it and hopefully it will be ok i had three xrays so i'm hoping if it was not good they would have picked something up my work may come through yet and then i will have it done gary",

          "completely sympathise lulu. a few days ago i felt so frustrated and angry about all of it. i've decided to ignore all the time scales for getting better (as it seems to be mostly guesswork), and concentrate on being better tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then the next day and so on. if i think about 6 months and more then it becomes very hard to take. i'm not looking forward to taking an anti body test either for all the reasons you've described. if i show as negative then what does it mean, and all the people who will say stuff. ugh. i feel for you. if it isn't covid that you/we have had then what is it? what have we all contracted within days and weeks of each other? bit of a coincidence.yes it's frustrating. anyway let's hope for better days soon. take care.",
          "from what you have said over the weeks and from having 3 clear x-rays i'd say you are probably similar to me and there are issues that only time and the lungs healing from inflammation will put right. if work offer to pay that is a different matter. i have been thinking whether i need to see an ent specialist about my throat but again if i think about it logically i think it is all down to inflammation as most of time it is not sore only if i overdo it or don't drink enough water during day. lx",
          "these test are not accurate, i didn't lose my taste or smell my sister did and she recovered after 4 weeks, what blood groups are we all i'm a positive. they say the t cell testing would be more accurate as well. i'm not feeling so hot today have been for my walk tho. my hubby sprayed fabreze on all the furniture not sure if that's affecting me? and my backs hurting now i do problems with it tho.",
          "i get that weakness around 6.30 every day when thinking about cooking dinner (that is not a joke!) i literally can hardly stand up and when i was at my worse this was when the downward evening spiral would start.yes carry on resting - i have just done a 1.5 mile hilly walk a bit of housework this morning (thinking of asking our cleaner if happy to come back but feel need to tell her about me being ill and then pretty sure she won't want to come into house - another dilemma!!). it could be the lack of carbs etc. making you feel more tired with the new diet.i need to just work out a short speech and stick to it!! me too, so so bored - bored of resting, bored of going for a walk, bored of taking mucodyne, bored of coughing night and morning, bored of taking loads of supplements, bored of oximeter and blood pressure monitor (actually stopped using those last few days which is good).what do they say about link to loss of taste etc. does that show more likely to be mild or serious case?lx",
          "yes or too much talking or prosecco i'm sure we are due for the inflammation to start easing i've tried everything and i feel it is a lot better than it was two weeks ago gary as for the throat i think that will go with it with a bit of luck",

          "agreed lulu not many people get it. it is frustrating. lots of folks are telling me it is mostly anxiety. i know some of it is, but the anxiety isn't coming from nowhere. we still feel the physical effects of the recovery. sorry it has been a bad day for you. i have had a few bad days myself. i just hope i am better by the time of my wedding at the end of the summer. surely this cannot last that long...",
          "totally agree with everything you've said lulu. i've never had breathing issues before all this. the doctor was the one to suggest a test as he wants to know if it's not covid could be something else. but like you and i know it's defo covid. he seemed shocked to hear i was still suffering so will defo be speaking to him again. this week has been difficult but hopefully we all get better soon. going for the tests monday morning. rufio you've got something lovely to aim for positive thoughts. just keep taking one day at a time and you'll get there. !!",

          "good evening jim and everyone that did make me laugh no s..t sherlock i've been through the same thing with a lot of people because they haven't had it even a lot of people who i know say to me see you soon for a few drinks gary well actually you won't why they ask well i'm still i'll and i really don't fancy coming out till it does one some people who do know what it is and haven't been out at all my mates mum hasn't and won't because she is terrified also forgot to ask everyone do you all forget things with this like you will be doing something leave it and do something else then realise after? gary",
          "hi jim ditto with the mucus it's a lump at back of throat that won't budge. yes tiredness and mood maybe it fits in with the timeline of this thing!! i think the virus has left us but has triggered something like a side effect. we're the unlucky ones. do you know what bloods you had taken? i'll be asking what the doc has requested on monday. i'll be curious about antibody test after lulu's result. you've got more tests haven't you?",
          "yes my memory has been effected, i just thought it was me lol. i know i'm getting on a bit 54 but it must be one of the symptoms !!",
          "i thought i was losing me marbles i made a drink earlier went sat back down on the phone forgot all about it another symptom got lots of red dots on my neck to join the club gary",
          "steph,both doctors did full spectrum blood tests, whatever that means showed nothing except low sodium. that does make you feel sh?te which i can confirm but i'm still suffering from the covid.as for antibody test my doctor ssid its pointless in my case as it would not orove anything.regarding memory loss, yes i have that and its not an age thing. its short term memory. bizzare, milk out if the fridge and i go and get another out.",
          "hi jim, sorry to hear you are having a bad one again. me too today. chest pain and headache. feel like going to bed. hopefully better tomorrow for all of us. seems like a bad day all round really. all the best.",
          "some people are getting rashes with this gary. maybe keep an eye on your temp has that been ok ? i've had brain fog recently it's like a hungover that never goes away.",
          "it is so frustrating when you feel you are doing well and then another set back. i am not feeling the anxiety so much now i sort of got worn out feeling so anxious all the time but that may be because overall have been more stable. although feel anxious after been out imagining i have caught it again which is stressful - am paranoid about not touching anything/hand washing etc. not getting takeaways etc. which i am sure everyone is but feel am worse than someone who hasn't had this.no it can't go on that long... you will be better by then, no question about it. stay positive.lx",
          "know what you mean about antibody test i wasn't fussed about having it done as i know i've had it and suffering as a consequence !! just wondering why the tiredness is getting worse.",
          "i put paracetamol and tin foil in freezer the other day then i'm talking and forget what i was saying, and forget i've got oven on. think it's because we're we're mentally exhausted. or losing the plot lol.",
          "that's one of the things i never had i get the sweats at night steph but my tempature is fine got a tester oximeter and a inhaler just in case nothing for red spots though gary",
          "think we've all had a bad day to day maybe the weather effects us.",
          "be interesting to see what the antibody test says steph - i really hope it is positive for your sake! after i deliver my long-winded speech explaining the ins and outs of the c-19 antibody testing and how you can get false negatives i can see people looking at me with scepticism thinking - \"yeah yeah yeah so basically you've had a bad cold \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\" - if only!lx",
          "i think it is the tiredness/stress of dealing with this sh&t 24/7 which makes you forgetful - i am same. i feel very stressed doing things i could have done with my eyes shut before - think you have to be careful not to lose your confidence.can't think what the red dots are other than a shaving rash?!lx",
          "i'm glad i'm not the only one susan it's definitely down to the little sugar might have to start doing something like my times table get my brain working a bit \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "i'd hate to see what i've got on my head when they finally take my hair off probably blue circles i just hope when it finally goes i get my marbles back or i'll be having a wee word with matt hancock if i remember gary",
          "might sound bad, but if i get a negative antibody test i might just tell everyone it's positive to save me the oxygen! \ud83d\ude02",
          "yes that's why i'll not say too much about having test. it's hard enough explaining to everyone we're still ill , let alone not having any antibodies !!! bad colds don't last 3 months !! being this ill has changed my attitude and tolerance towards certain people especially ones that question !!",
          "do you know what .... i really wish i had! i nearly did but then worried that might be asked at work to produce it. i've been told my office are getting all their staff tested so will probably have to taken another one at some point.one thing to bear in mind though steph and everyone else is if you get a negative and your gp is issuing your sick notes for work it may change what they diagnose you with and employers may then question amount of time off work - at the moment mine says \"suspected covid 19\" my gp does not know i had a negative as it was done privately and i asked them not to notify my gp for this very reason. different if you had a positive swab test i suppose.lx",
          "jim, can you get the mucodyne tablets from your doc? - i think they really help me to clear mine. i think they take a little while to work (a week or so) but i am certain they do as an hour or so after taking i can move mine (i take 2 3x a day). i have been on them from the start and on third prescription and feel panicky if i run out. just a thought if you can ask gp again i think may help you.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone happy anniversary going to celebrate with a beer today 13 weeks for me lulu and stuart same dry night little sweats and earache but not as powerful as normal so hopefully easing little fatigue sounds like the advert little wees not going to stop me having a walk i'm hoping everyone has had a good night gary",
          "my best periods have definitely been when it was sunny and warm. i don't think being indoors for long periods helps.",
          "happy week 13 gary. unbelievable how it's been this long and how quickly the weeks are passing. let's hope we aren't here wishing each other happy christmas! \ud83d\ude32no idea how the day will go for me, too early to tell. hope you feel better today gary and everyone.",
          "that's a new one stuart happy week let's hope so just be happy to get to week 14 with a couple of symptoms doing one bit wet in watford where i am still had a walk gotta try and build my appetite up for sunday fathers day and my daughter is cooking hope it's not too hot enjoy whatever your up to gary",
          "morning lulu,i've just collected a course of generic mucodyne tablets from my doctors and the first two taken.i hope it takes less than a week to shift this mucus. originally, i didn't have a problem moving it because i was drinking plenty(too much according to by blood test results and doctor), which caused my low sodium that in turn made me feel so much worse.hope you all have a good day,jim.",
          "morning all just been down to sainsbury not alot of people there that early, still got my back pain today must be all the walking i'm doing. my mucas never comes up just hangs there maybe it's to do with my sinuses, it does clear when i walk etc. not nice here today so prob not a long walk today. how r you all? \u2764\ufe0f",
          "morning everyonegood luck with mucus, jim, hope you can shift it soonhope everyone's symptoms improve today. 3 months for me tomorrow!just been celebrating ok ecg results by changing the bed. i didn't get very far, trying to recover from it!have a good day :)",
          "just want to say thanks for everyone responding for the heart palpitations that i was experiencing...was a little worried\ud83d\ude44 . ecg and blood test results back and everything normal excpect a little high on calcium but nothing to worry about . the gp i spoke to asked me alot of questions ....how long its been and what symptoms been experiencing etc etc.....he told me he is coming across alot of patients like me . he wants to repeat test again in2 months and he will be in touch every 2 weeks. i suppose that's better than what i got 10 weeks .ago ....'if you still breathing and can walk to bathroom than you're ok '\u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\ude21blood type is a . by the way i love the turmeric tea with honey and now my daughters are hooked on it too . take care everyone and hope you all having a good day . diane",
          "morning susan i've been out as well i'm not going to push it though resting now i feel like we have to get some sort of balance with what we do and our medication building it back up but not over doing it i've found out that certain times my medication works and other times it doesn't with the little sugar i've taken like the tablets and whatever symptom just carries on doing what it wants and other times eases off might be just me anyone else's opinion gratefully received gary",
          "morning jimthat is good news they will help - i can notice now an hour or so after taken the mucus feels looser and can cough it up and spit it out which i couldn't before. hope you are feeling a bit better for the weekend. i have rested more last couple of days and feeling better again so it is proof that we mustn't overdo it just because feeling better. i am still getting really tired but read somewhere that is because your immune system has been in full swing fighting virus basically takes every ounce of energy out of you and also energy required for body to repair which all makes sense.lx",
          "glad everything is ok diane and that your doc seems to be taking your symptoms seriously at last. turmeric tea for me too. hope you have a good day.",
          "hi jim, did you have to ask for the mucodyne tablets or was it your doc's idea?",
          "just seen a dr on this morning they are in the process off making a inhaler for when you first get the virus to use at home. they r testing it now.",
          "that's 3 of us with blood type a it might be a pattern?",
          "happy anniversary gary and stuart my c19 partners \ud83d\ude00let's hope 13 is our lucky number and we see big improvements this week. yep don't even think about still being here at christmas stuart it's not happening!! in my mind i think 18 weeks is the magic number - probably because my cousin's friend said felt fully recovered at 18 weeks - anyway let's not jinx anything and stay positive and just press on and hopefully the bad days will become less and less \ud83e\udd1ehave a good day.lx",
          "such good news diane i am really happy for you - you must be relieved with the results and good the gp will check in with you regularly - made me really laugh \"if you are still breathing and can walk to the bathroom you are ok\" that is exactly what we have all basically been told - \"stop making a fuss - you can breathe, what more do you want?!!\" i think there are thousands of people like us struggling through this but how lucky were we to have all \"found\" each other - it has made such a difference to this awful experience.take care,lx",
          "morning stuart,i asked for them on tuesday but he forgot them.being honest i've asked on numerous occasions loads of doctors for them and they all poo poo'd the idea.this one thought it was a good idea, so i seized the opportunity.hope you have a good day.jim.",
          "brilliant so good ecg results came back ok jo - what better way to celebrate than changing the bed!! that is exhausting at the best of times! positive news really gives you such a boost doesn't it - maybe a small glass of wine to celebrate tonight?enjoy weekend,lx",
          "morning susan, sounds like you and were up and it early today! my back pain comes and goes but much less than it was. i had random pains in left side of chest weds and yesterday really sharp which not had before but think were probably unrelated - maybe just indigestion/wind \ud83d\ude33 trouble is you don't know so made me nervous. just had email to say david lloyd club fully open mid july so in theory can go back to my outdoor swimming but not sure how it will be policed with the locker rooms etc. but positive that things are slowly getting back to normal - i'll be lucky if can do a length of doggy paddle after this - prior to this i swam 50 lengths front crawl in under 30 mins - seems like a life time ago but will be something to aim for!think weather better next week so back to your lovely long walks then.lx",
          "hi dianei just posted a reply to you but i've lost it, it just disappeared! so you'll have to excuse me if this is the 2nd one. technology and brain fog!anyway great news with your results, it's such a relief and you're really lucky to have a good doctor doing follow-ups. i have to go back next week for blood tests, so will see what happens next for meenjoy your day :)",
          "thanks lulu i'm really relieved about it, yes definitely need a glass of something, i've got a couple of little bottles to have from mother's day! can't believe i've left them so long.hope you have a good day and enjoy your weekend x",
          "yes happy anniversary to you lulu. happy days!!! \ud83d\ude02 you're right about staying positive, although in all honesty i've struggled to do so this week. but it did occur to me that out of all my family and loved ones if anyone was the best candidate to go through this thing it's me. it would have been far more devastating for everyone else due to various other circumstances. so i can always find a plus in a pile of negatives. day by day we will get there. by the way i had the chest pains yesterday too, still there a bit today. not sure what is going on there as it feels different. mostly on the left. feels like people are a bit more positive today though, i really hope so. have a good day.",
          "i'll be very interested to know how it goes with them jim. must admit that having this collapsed or blocked area of lung does worry me a bit and i am surprised i have not had something similar suggested to me to help clear it. how's that acapella thing going?",

          "you should definitely try and get these stuart especially with the mucus in the lung on your x-ray i reckon would help you. just makes it thinner, less sticky and more moveable - that surely has to help?agree about being the best candidate if i think about it i probably feel the same.lx",
          "it's a tricky one lulu. i don't know if the lung thing is collapsed or due to mucus blockage. i won't know until mid july when they xray me again. i don't know if i am bunged up with mucus or not as it's all so dry and nobody has examined me. don't know if it can be harmful if i don't need it. looks like i need to ask \ud83d\ude0a",

          "yes specialist told me not to use inhaler - gp prescribed blue inhaler (never used one before) right at the start of this nightmare but he was quite adamant that shouldn't introduce anything into lungs.really positive news re. work steph but i think we are lucky that we do \"office\" jobs and can wfh but much harder for you guys who do more physical jobs - there is no way i'd be ready for that. i'm planning on going back 2 july but am grateful that i only work two days a week but still think it will wipe me out as it is pretty full on. lx",
          "jim i was prescribed a steroid inhaler a week ago but i decided not to take it. the nurse wanted me to take it for two months but if in the meantime i see the specialist and they tell me to stop then i should stop. i wasn't sure about it. in 13 weeks nobody has checked my breathing or any of my vitals, so handing out a steroid whilst knowing i have a damaged chest didn't seem right to me. i decided to wait. add to that that lulu's specialist advised against inhalers i thought it seemed a bad idea. maybe your doc will have a different view. sorry to be negative but i am having a bad afternoon and evening. chest very tight, breathing not good and very painful chest when i cough. pretty fed up. all the best jim.",
          "hi stuart,thank you for the information, appreciated.i'll abstain on everyone's advice i think.sorry to hear your having a bad turn pal, we all know how it is. sleep well,jim.",

          "hey stuart,you probably did this already, but maybe look up some of the coping techniques for anxiety. at first, i was resistant to it because i am supposed to be a \"tough guy\", but i have been looking more into it and found the information helpful. symptoms include the chest pain and trouble breathing, which we both seem to have. i do not have any mucous in my lungs, however i know that the constant worry is playing a huge part. either way, there are some breathing techniques and mental exercises that can certainly help us all cope. i might even try meditating tonight :-/ whatever works!",
          "hello rufio, thanks for taking the time to reply. i know what you mean about the anxiety. in actual fact because i had a few rough years recently i did 18 months of therapy to learn about coping with stress and anxiety, so i'm pretty aware of all its effects on the mind and body. i used to be a bit embarrassed to admit it but not anymore, it's better to be honest about it. i wish it was anxiety causing my problems at the moment as i could deal with it. it's my lungs in this case and strained muscles from coughing. i was tempted to go to a&e earlier as i feel it's getting worse. hopefully tomorrow will be better. i really appreciate your suggestion as it certainly is a real problem. take care and be well.",
          "you too jim goodnight",
          "thanks joanne, yes i'm playing it by ear not going to commit myself fully until i feel better and yes i'm hopeful we'll all make a full recovery this little \"sugar\" won't beat us !! goodnight xx",
          "of course we all need to take our own medical advice about the inhalers so please do whatever you feel right for you and what doctors have recommended - i just felt a bit uncomfortable about it and that is why i checked and decided not to use.sorry you are not feeling well stuart i think our symptoms have been similar and i too have had awful times with the mucus and coughing it is so distressing and exhausting.getting checked out at a&e wouldn't be a bad thing maybe they would do a ct scan straight away if know you have had an xray already and things are not improving. you should have been monitored more closely given the result of your x-ray - the gps seem to have been quite negligent in many cases knowing people are so unwell and not following up with them and offering further investigations. take care, hope things are better tomorrow. lx",

          "i feel same with throat and mouth but not had any issues with eyes (yet!)- let's be honest it is about time it did one \ud83d\ude02 i think as the inflammation gets better in the chest and lungs you produce less mucus and then the tightness does one too \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude02 i was told it is the build up of mucus in the lungs which makes chest feel tight. your body produces the mucus to protect lungs because they are inflamed as the inflammation subsides you should produce less mucus. you always will have mucus but not excessive like this. my chest is improving but it is very slow. even my bald tongue is looking less bald this morning!don't quote me on any of the above it is only what i have been told/read but sort of makes sense to me! we are going to friends for socially distanced drinks in garden this evening - taking own chair, drink, glass, nibbles - yep this little experience has left me totally paranoid!! it's going to take a long while to get back to any sense of normal.lx",

          "thanks so much for the good wishes gary and everyone else, it means a lot to me and raises my spirits no end.i'm stuck in a catch 22 situation at the moment as my chest feels very congested but i can't cough to shift it because it is very painful to do so. just got to stick it out i suppose. it's sunny here on the south coast so i'm in the garden and the benefits of the warm sunshine are immediate, feel much more comfortable in all departments. might have to move to the algarve if the sun is my cure!! \ud83d\ude02interesting what you say about the inflammation rising, i haven't had that but maybe it's a good sign that it's on its way out.all appendages crossed for you \ud83d\ude01i hope everybody has a good weekend. all the best to you gary, and everyone!",
          "thanks macie, lots to read there. appreciate you posting it. have a good day.",
          "thanks lulu, hope you have a comfortable and improved day, enjoy your social evening. sounds nice. all the best.",
          "cheers joanne, much appreciated. good idea taking it easy. changing beds is like running a marathon for me. ridiculous! hope you're right about it being on its way out. enjoy your day. all the best.",
          "what do you mean by rising gary?",
          "hi stuart,do you take any ibuprofen? is it your lungs that are painful? or muscles between the ribs?",
          "just feels like coming up to the throat or getting higher weird thanks for that article got so much good information how you getting on maciek you nearly there gary",
          "hi stuart have you tried what susan suggested lemon and warm water might help you i don't know what else to suggest hopefully you will have a good weekend gary",
          "thanks maciek for sharing this will definitely read.jo/gary - i think it might be \"moving on up\" ... can feel a song coming on?!! i hope so maybe eventually it pops out of our mouth and we are all better? who knows, all i do know is i am sick of this whole thing. my partner did point out this morning though how long things take to heal in your body and when i broke my leg about 4 years ago it took ages around 6 months - yet another great period of my life \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02enjoy your time with daughter jo and phone call with son, wow i thought mine was a long way away in la.stuart hope the sunshine helps it's going to be a scorcher next week so hopefully we will all benefit from that.steph, have a great day and yes all you dad's hope you have a good day tomorrow.a friend of mine just told me her ex husband is working at a covid rehab ward at our local hospital - never knew these existed obviously for those who have been in hospital - can you imagine if what we have had is only moderate what those poor people are going through - just doesn't bear thinking about. lx",
          "personally think the hospitals have capacity now and the government needs to get the economy back up and running - the risks are less but still there. i am not going back to shops/pubs for time being. i just shop online for everything now. not even that keen on seeing my son in london after last weekend was so busy and not much social distancing going on - i felt anxious afterwards so will have to facetime him for a while.lx",
          "thanks so much macie for sharing this. it's about time! i wish something like this had been available earlierenjoy your day",
          "your probably right that they have to get the economy up and running again i really feel for all those people in hospital that have had it really bad still think we have as well was thinking about about having a meeting in the park say next june when this is over just bringing our own stuff and having a chat with everyone who can make it would be great to say thanks well for just being there what does everyone else think if you want to just get on with your lives will understand gary",
          "hi maciekjust read this - it is very informative - one thing i still do not understand is why we are taking so long to recover when all the info still seem to indicate it is only people who have been in hospital especially icu who might take this long - do you think it is just lack of knowledge still at this stage or were we very close to needing to be in hospital or maybe we should have been in hospital? they only seemed to determine taking you in by oxygen levels and mine never went below 96 as far as i am aware. maybe just a case of the length of recovery time for many people other than the mild cases is coming to light?lx",
          "thanks gary, good idea to save energy, tomorrow will be family day for me too, so trying not to do too much today. enjoy wkend",
          "hi gary, i did some adjustments and some experiments on myself. so here are my conclusions: i took flarin for 30 days and it is awesome, it reduced pain everywhere, now i'm taking 10 days break and will continue with it. i don't understand why gp don't recommend this in uk for us, specially for patients who have costochondritis. well many questions arise regarding help we got so far. like wtf gp refused to prescribe mucolitics? so let's stop there. supplementation and diet: i added lysine to everything that i take, read about it it seems to work. i changed turmeric to curcumin (turmeric extract) can send you link on amazon it is much better and helps with inflammation, it is much stronger. one tablet is extract from 30g of turmeric. i also changed my died to be focused more on proteins to give my body building blocks to recovery, it seems reasonable. so far it is 3 days and can feel improvement. regarding lungs: i noticed that what has bothered me is dust, pollen and other irritants, you can google hyperactive lungs and see what i mean by that. i was wearing n95 mask and didn't help, but i tried to modify it so it is tighter fit and boom no cough, no phlegm etc. i started in the morning after my morning coughing routine and as soon as soon as i took it off, everything was back. so have my answer it is not a virus it is my immune system. at home i have air purifier with hepa filter so it is clean as laboratory and can breath easily. i hope that it is only temporary from lung inflammation and it will pass. regarding ''rising'' inflammation: i had that feeling from lung alveoli to bronchi, and this is where it is now. so i guess ''rising'' is a good think. i hope that this helps anyone. this is all my own empirical research, but i looked today at the leaflet that i posted earlier that some of the staff i do is recommended, eg protein focused diet. i've been working since monday, but reduced hours. it was horrible after 11 weeks off monday after work was knackered, in pain. but tuesday paced myself and same for the rest of the week. survived all week. next week i'm off so will rest and if i don't relapse i will be back week after next, but also reduced hours. it is all based on spoon theory for people with me/pvfs or as today's leaflet say bags of sugar. slowly we'll get there. very slowly. please don't get me wrong i'm still not there yet and have good days and bad days, but i know it is autoimmune and will balance itself. if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask, i'm here all week ;)",
          "i know we've all tried everything now, stuart, but have you tried warm compress on sore/tight chest. i've used mine all the way through and i find it really helps( i've got a bag with wheat and lavender that i put in microwave- didn't cost much,from savers i think)enjoy your day",
          "lulu you made me laugh imagining it popping out of our mouths and that's the end of it alleach day with the mucus i think will this be the last of it?enjoy your evening x",
          "i heard really interesting interview with the doctors, one of them was covid positive for 96 days and is ok now, still have some symptoms tough. it looks like they are leaning more into the direction that i fully support from the very beginning. that we are now having autoimmune reaction to virus. if we are shedding dead virus as she was for so many days our immune system think that it is still there therefore it is still in pro inflammation mode, or maybe virus messed up with some pro inflammatory systems in body. either way my believe is that it is now not a virus per se but our body. it will pass, it needs to recover. it is normal for body and it is very individual thing. we all recover at different pace and we don't know why. when my wife cuts herself two days later there is no sign of cut, it takes me weeks to heal if i cut myself. both healthy and eat same diet. there is a theory that adding oxygen during recovery speeds up process. so maybe that's why. maybe because it is autoimmune that is why steroid therapies work so well? i hope they will find the answer. i'd rather skip this kind of therapy same with plasma therapy. too many side effects. there is a lot of research going on and it is very interesting. if you'd like go on youtube and search this: covid-19: steroids and other therapies, & covid patients with persistent symptoms: what\u2019s going on?you may find this interesting if you start from minute 30-ish please note that i'm not trying to lecture anyone or trying to be a smart ass, ;) i just find this fascinating as i did with hiv. just my interest.",
          "i'd definitely be up for that but maybe we should do it before june why not mid-september give us something to aim for? it might end up just you and me \ud83d\ude02 but would still be good to meet up and obviously depends where people live.lx",
          "so much information thank you. still want to take flarin but feel worried - i know gary takes it - have you noticed a difference stopping it for 10 days? i think i will get some - is it same as ibruprofen but easier on stomach?lx",
          "yeah i don't have a problem with when i just thought because we are in june give us a year to shake off all these ailments \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "thanks maciek im still drinking the turmeric tea and taking flarin vitamin d and k source of life liquid gold which has both im getting there i know it i know it will take time but my work has given me that so i will not rush it and work out the same as you not to do it all at once thank you for all your help gary",
          "yes, break in taking it made a massive difference, almost instantly, well next day :), my ribs started to hurt and lungs as well. but not as much as they use to, i couldn't sleep before flarin it was so painful. i'll start taking them after 10 days for sure. this is the best thing that made the biggest difference in my inflammation. which is now manageable, i think it is because of curcumin that i take. well get there. flarin it is ibuprofen, but lipid version so it is not digested in stomach, allegedly ;) but i spoke to some doctor and he said that i can take it for up to 30 days (please have in mind that it was advice given to me and as you mentioned we are all different).",
          "hi macie, first off thanks for all the info you have posted. lots to take in. no doubt i will have questions. as for the chest pain it is hard to say. last week it was definitely intercostal but after two days it got better, now it feels more from inside. whether the pain is muscular or lung i don't know. i have taken ibuprofen but not much. not sure about it to be honest. i did change my diet to eat lots of vegetables but it's interesting you suggest more protein.. there's been a lot to read today so will take a while to digest it all. thanks again, i hope your recovery continues. speak soon.",
          "blimey, hope we are better before next june \ud83d\ude02",
          "hi joanne, thanks for the suggestion. i started doing the heated pad thing last week. 12 weeks later than i should!!! \ud83d\ude02 it certainly helps, wish i had thought about it before. thanks again.",
          "yeah i do i'm up for either just be good to see everyone who went through flu like symptoms \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "ha! yep if only it would just pop out and we'd be done \ud83d\ude02 i think the same how much mucus can one person produce?! have to say though mine is slowly getting less - a few weeks ago i was constantly spitting out all day whereas now mainly morning only, a bit before bed (it's very romantic around here \ud83e\udd22) and the odd spit throughout the day but not so much as before - notice if i've exercised or done a long walk it causes me to have to spit it out - hope no-one is having their lunch reading this \ud83d\ude2clx",
          "i will give it a go gary. thanks for suggesting. take it easy sir.",
          "it is not only me, i've been doing this last few days an in the leaflet that i had today and shared with you they suggested this as well. what i thought that if we have damage in lungs our body will need proteins to repair it as it is soft tissues. so far we all focused on vegetables and fruits because they have a lot of vitamins, but there is very few proteins. i also limited milk products as they increase mucus production. it didn't work so far, therefore i decided to change. i feel better, have more energy an feeling of recovery, hope it is going to continue. well proteins are good source of energy as well.",
          "no me too, find it all very interesting and i think you are right that maybe people given oxygen recover quicker or maybe their lungs are not so damaged/inflamed as they had help. i'll check out the youtube vids too. i think all just grateful to get as much info as possible so thanks for sharing and positive no-one thinks you are being a smart ass - i did wonder if you were a doctor at one point though as you seem to know your stuff!lx",
          "afternoon lulu, gary, steph & everyone! i\u2019ve been quiet trying to sort out all my cardiology stuff. ive had a tricky week going back on a beta blocker after trying a 3rd kind and being worse. i can\u2019t remember if i explained that i got diagnosed with paroxymal svts a few weeks ago. had the them years & have no idea what theyve got so so so much worse the last few weeks. yesterday i had to go to hospital in london (my sister had to drive as im not allowed to - or use the underground as moderate risk -but then i can\u2019t really because haven\u2019t got the energy) to have a seven day ecg monitor fitted and have an echocardiogram and some blood tests. it looks as if i have to have a catheter ablation in a few weeks. well it\u2019s been advised as much , because i\u2019m not getting on with these drugs and not medicated i have svt's every day. i\u2019m still exhausted and still not sleeping properly: my chest gets very tight, i\u2019m getting these awful cramps down the middle of my breast bone into the stomach area. theyre unbelievably uncomfortable and no one knows what they are. that coupled with the breathlessness, which could be reflux with beta-blockers ive been put on or constipation (from blockers) , asthma, the little sugar, who knows ! today i cried all morning as its all got too much. i don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s really much improvement although it could be a side-effect of the beta-blocker. constantly giddy, often feel like my body is in g force, i cough after i eat. by the evening my throat is sore (the acid reflux)? and feels a little sharp, theres mucus and a feeling like a heavy butterfly vibration in the back of my mouth, like in the back palet and across my chest. i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s angina or some other weirdness. it\u2019s making eating very hard and i still continue to lose weight. im nowhere near as functional as i need to be. i do actually clean the hob i have to go and sit down and empty the laundry into a basket i have to go and sit down. i was a little bit like this before because i have m.e, fibromyalgia and bowel disease but it definitely seems a lot lot worse now . in the gaps between my beta-blockers i can\u2019t even walk upstairs without my heart rate going crazy i can\u2019t even ring down before my body wants to go into svt! seems so strange this is all so much worse the kast 12 -13 weeks. my gastro said to not getting any more consultants involved but i still want to go to someone respiratory or asthma specialist to help because i don\u2019t really know what to do now. i literally can\u2019t take the breathlessness much more. i don\u2019t think the ablation its self will be answer to everything and i\u2019m really dreading it and the recovery. i\u2019m sorry if i come across a little bit deflated i think i\u2019m pretty overwhelmed by this inflammatory storm. i\u2019m sorry if i come across deflated . im quite low , although that could be the beta-blocker side-effects. i\u2019m pretty overwhelmed by this inflammatory storm & not feeling any relief. i really hope everyone is having a day better than mine! i\u2019m really hungry i need a snack but i want to make sure it\u2019s not going to set off an in flames throat this evening.",
          "that's very sweet. i always wanted to be a surgeon, but unfortunately my hands started to shake early in my life and it doesn't help in this profession. ;) but my home was always full of medical books as my mum was a nurse and her passion was medicine. my favourite book as a child - atlas of human anatomy ;) i'm not psycho though :dunfortunately, lack of response from doctors in the uk forced me to do a lot of research and i'm glad that everything is available online. i understood this early in my symptoms that i'm not going to get any help from my gp when he refused to prescribe me mucolytics and said to rest and that's all. if i listened i know my lungs would have much more damage. and your specialist gave you same advice to cough out the phlegm not let it dry in your lungs and take tablets to help you with it. we also have a lot of friends abroad who are doctors and medical professionals and they helped me a lot as well. and i also bought a lot of drugs online, eg yep mucolytics. i know that there are people out there who are like me and feel overwhelmed by all this experience, that's why i focus on sharing my experience as i can. at the end of the day we are all in this together ;) i hope they don't mind. hmm i also wanted to thank you once again for your help and brightness that you brought to this group, it is very much needed.",
          "ah that's interesting to hear your background! i just watched the youtube video was very useful - i can't remember who it was here maybe steph, jo or susan who could smell stale cigarette smoke - the woman who tested positive for over 90 days said she could smell forest fires and then later mentioned stale cigarette smoke so that is a recognised symptom. i think there will be many more people with extended recovery times than they initially think. it depends how you define \"recovered\" both the people talking about their illness are \"recovered\" as in back to work but both still have symptoms - did you notice the guy kept clearing his throat - this is something i do - sometimes wonder if it is now a habit.enjoy rest of day.lx",
          "hi mac, i just wanted to ask, what kind of proteins: things like meat, nuts? i\u2019m really struggling as i\u2019ve got acid reflux and certain things, which i can\u2019t quite work out, make my throat burn may be 10 mins later. pretty vile by the evening and i can\u2019t take antacids because of beta blockers. i\u2019ve been trying a sort of alkaline diet. although i desperately need to put on some weight and i can\u2019t seem to you on this. thanks.",
          "i had meant to reply to your name for some reason but i seemes to reply to gary instead by accident (see above). sorry gary no offence i\u2019m just finding this forum a little bit tricky sometimes!. waves to all, hope your afternoon is going ok?",
          "hi graceyreally sorry to hear you are still so unwell it sounds as if you are receiving medical attention and hopefully the 7 day ecg and blood tests will put your mind at rest - i think we have all found the breathlessness really hard to handle and on top of all the other medical issues you have going on it is not surprising you are anxious and deflated. it seems there is no one person who can answer all our medical questions and maybe a respiratory consultant would put your mind at rest on the breathing issues if you could get your gp to refer you. surely your gp must be aware of all your medical issues and should be monitoring you and co-ordinating your care.always happen to listen and try and eat something as need to keep energy levels up. how about poached eggs on toast or something similar with high protein. i also found fresh soups helpful.take care,lx",

          "hi everyone,not been on here for a few days ,trying to catch up \ud83d\ude02 i've been smelling the cigarette smoke for weeks now and i tested positive. hope you are all making some headway far too many posts to catch up sorry,i'll end up with a headache with my blurry eyes.i've had some bad mornings but the last 2 days have managed a 3 mile walk about lunch time when i'm feeling brighter and its felt so good,found some wonderful meadows through the woods that i've never been to before in the 15 years i've lived here....shocking.had a very long consultation with my doctor on the phone yesterday morning and he was very patient and understanding ,felt i was being listened to,he even gave me a cognitive test as i've been worried about some strange short term memory losses ,thankfully i passed and he put it down to the insomnia and anxiety he then told me he was signing me off for a month without me even asking,he said i didn't need the anxiety of keep calling up for a sick note.its taken a great weight of my shoulders i received peak flow meter was intrigued when jim said he had one and my blow is like a 75 year old (no comments \ud83d\ude02) my last one was 300 so i'm hoping i can improve with my new exercise routine .hope you all have a lovely evening i'm going for a little walk to post a letter and looking forward to a nice glass of red later \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf77x",

          "lovely to hear from you dawn - i knew someone had the cigarette smoke issue! 3 miles is great - i do similar distance and you definitely know you have done it and even better you have discovered some wonderful meadows and woods to walk through!i think it is a relief not having to worry about work - i know every time i am signed off for a fortnight i feel that relief!is that a lung function test? i'd be interested to know what mine is.just back from early evening drinks with friends - feel so much better for doing something normal - i definitely think this can be all consuming and on the days we feel well enough it is good to go out and socialise - i think the benefits are enormous and felt quite safe, took own drinks and nibbles etc. we didn't take own chairs in the end thought that was a bit overkill!! lx",
          "yes lulu it may be a good idea to start socializing if we can handle it. i used to be fun and sing and dance like crazy before this, but now i'm beat even after just listening to other people having a conversation. i look forward to getting back to my jolly old self. the future in-laws are coming by for dinner around the fire pit tonight, so it will be good to see them and \"practice\" being fun again.",
          "aww you will be back to that fun person dancing and singing very soon and think you will notice tonight how you can forget about c-19 for a few hours and how good it feels and how therapeutic it is - i think we are probably all suffering from a bit of post traumatic stress and we need to be kind to ourselves and take small steps to getting back to some sort of normal and hopefully all our family and friends will be supportive and understand it is maybe harder for us than others.hope you enjoyed your evening.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone gracey sorry your having a terrible time but i think lulu has answered you definitely need more care nice to see you back dawn good to see you got a doctor who is supportive and some new walks would like to say happy fathers day to all you dad's enjoy same night for me just got up later raining here as well hope you all had a better night gary",
          "morning gary and everyone!enjoy your day with your daughter and don't overdo it - i know easier said than done or at least factor in a rest day tomorrow! we are seeing family this morning looks like sitting in the garden in rain! hope everyone has a good day and are beginning to feel better overall. the sun is making a comeback this week so that should def help us out! lx",

          "it's very hard as we've all lost our confidence, i hate going into shops etc but force myself. and you get all the stupid people who haven't been infected or only mild that really don't understand the seriousness off catching this virus. i don't understand them. i really would never want to go through that hell again especially the elephant on the chest and the breath lose and bed ridden for or house bound for 8 weeks. i worry when i sneeze or cough that it's coming back. anyway enjoy your day everyone \ud83d\udc96",
          "i agree, i just feel a bit battle weary it has been such a struggle to get over this and i feel still have quite a long way to go. no-one other than everyone on here understands the battle and the anxiety - everyone who has has not been affected seems to think it is a big fuss about nothing and there is little social distancing going on now but as far as i am concerned the virus hasn't magically gone away - it is still out there people need to be aware but i think most people are convinced if they get it it will just be a mild case - it is only people who have had it that know differently and how awful it really is. i actually don't even think my partner fully understands - he has seen me ill but not experienced what it feels like and still feels like so how can he really know?have a nice day everyone.lx",
          "i was so anxious the first time i went out, couldn't understand why so many people were out and about and not caring about social distancing. i'm more easy about it now but still the only one in the shops wearing mask and gloves!my kids are supposed to go back to school this week, had to sign a document that asks if anyone in the family is showing symptoms...emailed the school to say i have symptoms but tested negative twice what do i write? waiting to hear back, taking them a while, guess they're not sure what to do in my case. hopefully they won't keep my kids off school cos of me.",
          "surely if you have two negative tests should be fine for kids to go back to school - it is tricky i've had difficult forms to fill in like that when i visit my mum in nursing home but i just put no to all the questions now otherwise i wouldn't be let in until all my symptoms go which could be a year! this is more the aftermath than the symptoms i think!i haven't been in a shop other than to pick up a prescription since beginning of march - the queues are so long around here even if i wanted to i can't be bothered to queue up for so long - we are lucky and get a weekly ocado delivery. if i did i would be same full ppe for me preferably with the plastic visor!lx",
          "happy father's day all!by me, you cannot get into a store unless you have a mask. they will turn you away. there is a lot of disagreement about the effectiveness of masks as well, but i stay out of the politics. it never helps to get involved when you are sick. also schools are still closed and we don't know if they will be opening in the fall. hopefully the virus weakens tremendously by that time. just like how the more people the flu went through way back when, the weaker it became against us.",
          "i'm all for the masks and hope they become compulsory. one night when i went to a and e some weeks back, a guy came in without a mask, waiting room was empty but he decided to sit right next to me and husband and was coughing heavily out in the open! just as well i already had the virus! we walked out and waited outside until the guy was seen to. it's for these kind of reasons masks should be compulsory.congratulations on your upcoming wedding rufio, what a crazy time this must be for you! hopefully you'll be fit as a fiddle way before.speaking about singing and dancing, it makes me quite depressed not to be able to sing, i always sing! it's one of my outlets, driving in the car by myself and belting out a good song. now i have to stop myself because it makes my chest hurt :(hope all having a good day.the 'rising' seems to be happening to me too, mucus back of throat and sore throat but other things not disappearing fast like muscle aches in upper body.been cheating on new diet. rationale: if feel rubbish anyway at least food should be enjoyable!",
          "i know sure my son thinks that way he said you haven't had it, it's nerves and anxiety he brought the kids up today but it's really hard trying to keep them in garden and distancing from me but think we managed it i said that to hubby i hope you dont get it but if you did your understand what it's like. its very hard everyone thinks it going and nearly over but theirs still nearly 200 dieing each day. i wear mask and gloves in shops and will continue to until its fully gone.",
          "think masks should be compulsory for the time being and let's hope it does just weaken and dies out before the autumn. there is an article (apologies if someone has already mentioned this one) but not sure i've seen it google what happens after you \"recover\" from covid 19? doctors and nurses reveal\" - it is interesting that they are beginning to see loads of cases like us coming through - it is not a depressing read - they are likening to pneumonia recovery - basically inflammation of the lungs is pneumonia so probably what most of us who have the respiratory problems are actually recovering from . that must be tough susan if your son thinks you have not had it! i have friends say to me \"i know someone who had it, y'know tested positive so definitely had it\" implying that i am just imagining it!",

          "ah thanks dawn - just had a look am tempted but have just literally put the oximeter away and stopped taking blood pressure and heart rate (it's been like a doctor's surgery around here for 12 weeks) so think i will pass on this in case i get fixated!! are you noticing a difference or is it too soon? be interested to see how you progress.have felt quite chesty and phlegmy again today - have sat around quite a bit so think that doesn't help and feel quite tired doing nothing! - well done on the 4 mile walk that is quite a hike but glad you saved enough energy to raise your wine glass \ud83d\ude1cha! bet he loved that \"look into my eyes, look into my eyes, the eyes, the eyes not around the eyes\" \ud83d\ude02 imagine being woken up to that at 6.30! enjoy the evening,lx",

          "*morning lulu and everyone that did make laugh dawn look into my eyes at 630 in the morning not a good day for me yesterday tried to spend more time with the kids but chest was tightening so needed to lie down bad night headaches and earache i had the same thing about 7 weeks ago i think headaches lasted for a few days i'm going to say a 9for the score still feel better but i'm hoping this week will be better for me gary *",
          "morning all,gary a 9 is great, hope the score keeps moving up!today is my week 14. going to go for 8 and 3 quarters. had a bit of difficulty saturday but yesterday felt a bit more normal, had my sis and bro in law round and enjoyed it and wasn't as exhausted as i would normally be after talking so much.spoke to holistic doc again to say the diet isn't giving me enough energy so she's modified it and it looks pretty much the same as my diet before i started talking to her so i'm pleased with that (and also wonder if i could just stick to my better instincts about my own diet!)enjoy the sunshine everyone!",
          "morning!sorry to hear that gary and typical as it was a day you hoped to feel good and enjoy with your family. i was same felt rubbish yesterday saw family in morning, cooked lunch and then sat around. started feeling really low chest was phlegmy, throat was sore no-one to moan to what can people keep saying to you after all this time?! worn out with keep picking myself up and staying positive. started feeling will never fully recover. when you think about it not one medical person has looked at me in person! throat still red after 13 weeks, tongue feels weird and the chest and tinnitus are ongoing. is it ever going to end? what on earth has this virus done to body and was so fit and healthy before. makes me want to cry. not sure how will cope with work next week even for two days as things are so up and down never know how going to feel from one day to next or even from morning to afternoon.anyway happy monday after that big moan!! hope everyone had better day and the only way is onwards and upwards i am sticking with 91/4 cant really see any progress this week.lx",

          "susan, gary, lulu these are great scores! don't get discouraged by a bad day think how far you've come. you'reon 9's! remember it's baby steps all the way. also, yesterday i woke up feeling really down and so weak but then felt ok during the day. it's up and down the whole time so if you're in a 'down' they'll be an 'up' coming soon!",
          "yes i know what you mean lulu the thing is i get up in the morning after i've shaken most things off take my vitamins have a cuppa turmeric and honey go for a walk not too far come back have a shower feeling good one thing i did notice this morning my wee is yellow wondering if that's to do with the headaches and earache i'm drinking all night because i feel like the inflammation has come up i'm hoping the flarin will kick in soon maybe this is our week need hair cut as well gotta be positive we'll done dane sounds like your improving good another good week for everyone this week i hope gary",

          "yes thanks for the positive words dane i know you are right - the thing is it is easy to blame everything on this - there are people who have been in lockdown feeling low who have not been ill so bit of a double whammy for us.i think you just hope and pray \ud83d\ude4f that there will be no more bad days and you are on an even keel and when one comes along i try and analyse it - what have i done? what have i eaten? have i walked too far/not far enough ... it is so disappointing and makes you realise you are still unwell. anyway am going to borrow dawn's big girl pants analogy \ud83d\ude1c and pull them up to arm pits and get on with it - am off for a walk probably 3.5 hilly miles - who knows if that is too strenuous or not but it's what ive been doing every other day for a while so will carry on!better days are ahead and well done everyone on scores, 9 and 8's are great and anything which is an improvement or even a stable week has to be good.lx",

          "morning guys,really concerned regarding my limits on exercise. i'm on week twelve on thursday and today i woke up feeling fine.i crept downstairs did my breathing exercises, clearing some mucus. this took around forty minutes with two seven minute lay downs for chest drainage.had my breakfast and felt drained. i could feel the on set of symptoms.sat watching tv for an hour and a half recovered.is this normal with little sugar?hope everyone is well,jim.",
          "jim, sounds very normal for little sugar.i'm on week 14 and can feel drained in the morning before doing anything, usually it gets better but can get exhausted around lunch time again. just went for a slow walk round the block and found it quite hard so resting now. take it easy if your body feels like it wants more rest so rest which is what you did watching tv. it will get easier eventually...",
          "thank you.",
          "maciek put a link on the messages for a video you tube really good to watch i will message him and ask him if he can put it on here for you jim also if you get a chance type in tim spector they are now coming to terms with all the symptoms little sugar pops up with interesting reading gary",
          "thank you gary.",
          "hello everyone, i hope that you are all well. gary asked me to share with you a video that i found on youtube regarding long haulers like us. but i cannot put a direct link as it will be moderated and you won't be able to see, therefore please go on youtube and type in: update of clinical features it is by dr john campbell, fella in the glasses ;) hope that you'll enjoy it, please let me know what you think? regards maciek",
          "thanks maciek really good watch gary",
          "yep i pulled them right up and feeling better already \ud83d\ude1c that's brilliant dawn so glad you can see some progress this week i think so long as things are moving in right direction that is all can ask for. the cigarette smell must be awful it was mentioned in the other video that maciek directed us to - must make you feel really nauseous. think the walking is a good guide to progress - i walk with a friend and used to have to stop and sit on a log initially but now can do the whole route 4.1 miles with steep hills non stopping and i am normally gassing at the same time which makes it more tricky!jim, it's good news you woke up feeling better today that is a positive! i know exactly what you mean and i too feel tired after the morning routine - that's when i normally sit down and type a few messages to you guys - getting up and ready for day definitely wears me out. i think for me with exercise it was just setting small goals, probably 6 weeks ago i could only walk to the end of our road, then we drove to walk on the flat and walked 10 mins, then started walking around here but very limited because of hills - so again when you look back you can see progress it is just sometimes you can't see the woods through the trees. my day is punctuated with resting but it is definitely a balance as if i don't do enough moving around my chest gets heavy and mucus collects which i think happened yesterday we sat around all afternoon and evening.will check the video on youtube - thanks again maciek for keeping us updated it really helps.lx",
          "hi maciek,thanks for sharing the video. interesting and validating i would say but not really too enlightening as to where we are all holding.what i think is important is he mentioned possible long term damage in some. i spoke to a gp friend who manages some of london's post covid clinics (they do exist! though not at my gp practice...) she sees patients like us regularly to do checks for heart and bloods so her patients are at least monitored, she told me i must ask my gp to see me in person and do relevant checks. will try call tomorrow but not overly hopeful she will agree.",
          "hi everyone :)hope you having good afternoonsit's all ups and downs with this, physically and mentally, we never know what's going to happen nextyou amused me dawn, with your romantic early morning greeting to your partner lolall these 8's and 9's! brillianti'm playing safe and going up a little to 7 1/2. i'm still working on the walking, becoming more confident with my fitness wristband, which tells me my hr, as it is getting high. it even praises me after my garden walk with a \"well done!\"thanks macie for video, will have a look",
          "that's great news jo - glad it is an improvement. i know mine watch tells me i've got to stand up \ud83d\ude33 i watched video not sure how i felt after that - i think we all know that symptoms caused by inflammation but it is a worry not to know whether any permanent damage has been done - i have to just keep thinking back to what specialist said which was \"you will get better\" - that has to be my mantra.anyway been acting quite normally today i had to go to post office and also to boots to get the flarin - managed both without acting weirdly around people - although i did gel my hands before getting back in car then needed to move the flarin box and then thought well that has touched the car seat and do i need to gel hands again and same when home another round of gel and hand washing! but overall a successful trip!lx",
          "yes we must keep positive, we are gradually improving and we know it'll take time. it helps to do normal things, but then people think we're better, but only we know what's really going on.i tried a little glass of wine at the weekend, it was lovely, but my stomach wasn't very keen on it, it was back to it's churning at night, but it was worth it, it made me even more tired though. the wine bottle is now on my medicine tray, although there's not much medication there now :)enjoy your evenings",
          "hi everyone, hope you're all doing well as can be. i've still got my swollen glands and i also felt like i was getting a cold but it's the little \"sugar\"jim like you've mentioned feeling very tired it's like it's starting all over again !! feel very achey so i've been using the deep heat patches. joanne i've been having a few drinks at the weekend but find i get palpitations when i try and sleep. so i know it's not a gd idea to think i'm back to normal just yet. maciek thanks for info about vid of doctor and all the other medical info much appreciated !!",
          "evening all,sorry i read through posts then forget who's written what,like the idea of the wine on the medicine tray though joanne \ud83d\ude02 and the wrist band that says well done ...stay away from amazon dawn \ud83d\ude48so pleased you felt better lulu after pulling your knics up ,get the panic when you're out with the hand gel ect..i'm still nervous at the shops ,actually hate it and will avoid as much as possible.managed a 3 mile walk today and like you used to lulu plenty of log sitting still ,on my own today so no gassing \ud83d\ude02 feel so good for doing it even though i ache tonight and chest a bit tight so maybe a day of rest tomorrow.watched the video maciek think i have probably read most of what he was saying at some point...good old google but its still good to hear about anything relevant to ourselves at least we know it's out there and being recognised.hope you all manage a good nights sleep .i'm having a small glass of red to help \ud83d\ude0ax",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've had a better day and night i got a cool gel pad you put in your pillow or on it it helps still had the sweats but got more sleep and didn't drink as much tight chest comes and goes earache but no headache still got something in my eyes in the morning but feels better suns out so going to stretch my lungs hoping you all feel better today gary",
          "morning all, gary, good to hear you're doing a bit better, having slept better will hopefully have you set up better for the day.question for all those mucus sufferers (apologies for the unpalatable topic so early in the morn) is your mucus clear? mine seems to be getting really thick and yellow (gross, sorry) especially in the morning when i cough it out. what do the rest of you have? just wondering if its like at the end of a cold where it all goes thick and therefore it's good, or not...?",
          "morning dane sorry can't help with that mines always white well at the moment it is i'm sure some one had that problem a few weeks ago can't remember who it was then i can't remember what i've been doing all the time \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "morning everyoneglad you had a better night gary and the pillow helped and overall you feel better. my throat is my problem and blocked nose sometimes one nostril sometimes both! throat is very dry and sore feels like whole of respiratory track inflamed..dane my mucus is clear always has been think it is reducing lately but as it does throat getting sore wonder if a connection. tried the flarin last night definitely helped but makes me feel a bit sick same as regular ibruprofen does.enjoy the day it is prosecco on the green tuesday for me how quickly does that come round?!! be interesting to see how feel tomorrow last two weds have not been good for me am wondering if hay fever remember how we were affected during the last hot spell and were all praying for rain?! lx",
          "morning lulu don't worry about the flarin it made me feel sick first thing but after was fine i think it is starting to help me and the tea plus i've started taking curcumin extract i will know in a few days just wish i could throw the tight chest out of the window i've done more today than normal first thing so hopefully won't pay for it later enjoy your prosecco all have a good one gary",
          "thanks gary do you take flarin every day and if so how many times? i have also started an antihistamine - it's mad i have never suffered from hay fever in my life but specialist mentioned being hyper sensitive and said should take them. i hate taking medication and now seem to be permanently popping pills!the chest tightness is a problem but mine seems better and so long as i keep the mucus moving - so many things we don't know the answers to we just have to keep going and believing it will all resolve itself as we fully recover.enjoy rest of day and glad you have done more.lx",
          "hi danemy mucus is clear with white bits(lovely subject!) it is a bit yellowy first thing in the morning. it seems to be getting thicker like you, maybe it's getting towards the end...we can hope lulu, my nose keeps blocking on and off too. i've started doing more steam inhalations (with towel on my head, leaning over kitchen work surface- seems more effective) it seems to be helping with nose, but i expect you're already doing it! hope it improves soon x",
          "thanks joanne, yes, delightful subject :)i've not really had any issues with mucus back of throat until last week or so and now noticed it's already quite thick.i am not overly bothered by it, usually it's morning and evening and i find after a shower it's easier to cough out, prob the steam helping.lulu, you mentioned the sore throat, mine comes and goes during the day and find it's better after a good throat clear out. can be really sore and then half an hour later it's fine!let's hope it's all part of the healing!",

          "thanks gary it definitely helped so will look at taking it more regularly.dane, the sore throat is very strange and mine is same and it comes and goes and also my tongue feels inflamed! i just do not understand how something can come and go! it cannot be a throat infection i don't think otherwise it would be there all the time and surely would get worse and i've had it for 13 weeks!jo, the steaming does help not done it for a while but will try that again.hope everyone has had a good day. had a lovely time with friend in the sunshine!lx",
          "hi lulu i've been the same with the sore throat as you know i feel that mines getting better maybe it's because you women talk too much \ud83d\ude02 i've not noticed mine for a few days unless it pops back gary",
          "hi guys,firstly, i hope everyone is well and improving.there is an article on the bbc website regarding covid. if you google bbc warning coronavirus, it is worth a read,once you've read it, i would suggest it is paramount to contact your gp and progress tests to evaluate possible lung damage from the virus. as we will all be aware x-rays don't necessarily show damage, whereas a ct scan will.i don't want to unnecessarily worry folk but seeing we're still suffering with ongoing symptoms and in reality the majority should have been in hospital originally, i consider reading the article and speaking with our gp's a must.i have previously asked for a ct scan but my gp said i would first have to be referred to a specialist who would then make the decision whether or not it was worthwhile. my gp's lead time for referral minimum two weeks and then a specialist would have to action etc. therefore the wait could be months.i'll be on the phone tomorrow morning. hopefully i'll get to speak to my gp but you never know.jim.",
          "hi jim i've already tried my gp without success hopefully yours is a lot better than mine and good luck gary",
          "hi gary,i remember you did and got the cold shoulder but read that article and try again pal.my gp is either going to sort it or i'll borrow the money and go privately.watched a good video on youtube this afternoon in relation to post covid fatigue and how to manage the symptoms especially the tiredness.",
          "hi jim,i think you are right. not to worry anyone especially as think the concern is really for people who were very sick in hospital but why not get ourselves checked at least for the reassurance that all is ok.spoke to my gp today and said i need further tests, i think she thinks i'm overly anxious as she suggested anti anxiety medication! but i don't care, she eventually agreed to follow up blood test and ecg , she also referred me to a respiratory specialist weeks ago but hasn't heard back yet so these things take time.by the way, anyone taking quercetin? how much are you taking?had a good day but was knackered by 3pm with tight chest and itchy eyes so had to rest. will try take it easy rest of the day (with 4 kids to do bath and bedtime on my own as husband working late...haha!).",
          "i take quercetin since very beginning 600mg 3xday",
          "i will jim and i will watch the video on how to manage the tiredness thank you gary",
          "hi maciej,what do you take quercetin for?cheers,jim.",
          "that's a nice amount.did you find it helped in any way?i've got 500mg quercetin with 1,400mg vit c in same tablet, couldn't find quercetin on its own.",
          "it has a lot of benefits, in the beginning i was using it as it is ionophore for zink, which means that it helps zink to get into cells. similar action as hydroxychloroquine does. that is why. now i use it as it is great antihistamine and it helps with glutathione which is amazing antioxidant, you can search more info about it as it is really awesome. i hope that it answers your question, if you are interested i can go into more details, but they may be boring ;) maciek",
          "sorry i made typo it is 500mg that i use, it is also with vit c. vit c helps with it, so do not worry. hope that helps maciek",

          "morning everyone!i'd definitely ask for a divorce dawn - i feel same am done with this and ready to move on! i read yesterday that the reason all the \"old\" original symptoms come back is when you over do it almost like your body reminding you you are not ready yet - interesting theory but not sure true!i survived tuesday prosecco and four hours gassing feel much better than last couple of wednesdays. started taking antihistamine not sure if that is helping - the specialist told me to take as thought had nasal drip and also would help with mucus and have to say have noticed a difference - just over the counter ones - i definitely feel like i've developed an allergy - keep sneezing now much to the annoyance of my other half - stopped coughing so much now in evenings but now sneezing all through the football - how inconsiderate of me \ud83d\ude02wonder if the mucodyne are helping you jim i really hope so. sounds like you are blowing well jim - so not too much to worry about and getting checked out now let us know how you get on.dawn enjoy your picnic and happy blowing!gary glad you are feeling better just need to sort out those night sweatsdane, i know it is hard to keep positive when you think you are on the mend and have a set back - i feel same just can't trust a couple of good days to materialise into even more good days, you just never know what each day will bring just done 4 .5 mile hilly walk it is hot out there so will be resting for the afternoon.lx",
          "i don't know either, i take 1500mg of quer and 1500 of vit c in it, but this is what i take. i also take a lot of different things. but my kind advice is that you should always listen to your doctor in the first place, they know pros and cons of all of the treatments they prescribe. well, at least they should ;) i'm glad that you found someone who listens and tries to find solution, my doctor when i ask him about megadosing of vit c he said that it will make my pee more yellow :d good luck. maciek",
          "lulu,the tablets seem to have kicked in, as all i have to do is a couple of deep breaths, a huff cough and up it comes.for anyone who is inquisitive about post viral fatigue and is feeling as we all do sensitive avoid youtube and searching it.i have just scared myself sh?tless.i'll let you know how the tests go.jim.",
          "thanks maciek!she's a homeopathic doc not my real doc and i hardly know her so just double checking everything she's telling me to do! told my gp i was doing this and asked for advice, she was all for it but couldn't tell me anything about supplements and doses.",

          "hi jim how r u feeling now.",
          "i think there's something good in getting back to work, for starters you are forced not to think about your aches and pains for a while. and if it's not full time not as scary as could be. i've been asked to help at work with something small (from home), it's also creative which i love and i have another person supporting me so i don't need to stretch myself too much. quite happy about it.one step forward. let us know how you get on lulu and susan.back to boring old symptoms, anyone got acid reflux and can you tell me what helped? i've got some famotidine from abroad, but gp can't advise about it.took lanzoprazole for a week, thought it wasn't helping but now it's worse so maybe it did help but didn't notice. it's a big issue for me now as it's making eating difficult. throat feels very congested and swallowing is uncomfortable. oh dear... will stop moaning now.",
          "hi everyoneit's been a hot day, had to go for blood test, will see what happens next when i get results next week. i've felt quite normal this week but any movement and my heart rate races. i want to move faster than my body does!i'm spending hours on the mucus removal too, jim, there's loads of itgood luck with getting xray gary, i don't know if i'll ever get one, but relieved to have had ecggood luck to those of you preparing to go back to work, i think it'll be a while for meenjoy your evenings :)",
          "hi sue,had a better time of it today, thank you.the old mucus is coming up by the table spoon full and i'm very weary of not doing too much, so other than a 15 minute walk i've sat about in the sun.i took a drive for 20 minutes, oh and done my breathing exercises.just going in the bath now, as i've a blood, spirometer and peak flow tests at the quacks tomorrow morning.how are you doing?oh i've been signed off for another month.jim.",
          "hi danei'm getting on ok with omeprazole from the doctor for acid reflux. i had a lot of stomach churning and chest pain which seems to have almost gone now.i've been given a repeat prescription for it, so i expect i'll have it for a while",
          "**hi joanne i have the same as you blood tests gp wouldn't give me a xray because i had one about a month ago glad to see your getting somewhere it does make you worry when you think that you've over done it enjoy your evening gary",
          "thanks joanne, glad it's helped you and great the stomach churning and chest pain have gone. do you reckon those symptoms were from the acid reflux? and how long til you noticed a difference with the omeprazole? thanks trying to figure it all out. i have chest pain but think it's muscular, it can feel very tight.",
          "i'm not sure dane, i think the chest pain is some sort of indigestion and i still get it a bit but the medication gradually improved everything. i take 2 a day and i'm on my 2nd pack now, so hoping it'll continue to work. hope you soon get relief from it",
          "good news it is all coming up jim - that is exactly what you need to happen i was doing that a few weeks ago and you will notice it gets less and less but takes a while it is a gradual decline. i was having a huge clear out morning and evening and various points during days. now i have a bit of mucus in mornings to clear and a little at night but think it is clearing up (can feel a jinx coming on!) - think the antihistamine has helped to dry up the mucus in throat and nose too.good luck for tomorrow - give it a good blow and get a good result! i reckon another week or so and you will be running round that garden.take care,lx",
          "had our first takeaway tonight after 12 weeks - so good to start doing normal things - involved quite a bit of hand washing but am trying really hard to calm down - it is not good to be in a state of anxiety for so long - it is not my normal style so am making a real effort to follow the guidelines but not be obsessive - am setting small goals for myself! boots and post office yesterday, takeaway tonight!!",
          "evening everyone, what a difference the sunshine makes !! lulu you're right i started back to work monday only doing half days working from home and feel ok. don't think i could manage travelling to work if i'd had to though. it's defo taking my mind off my symptoms a bit and catching up with work mates has defo cheered me up. it's important to be honest with managers about how you're feeling and if you're not well enough, take more time off. if work can arrange an occupational health assessment make sure you have one as it's in our best interest. jim we're nearly week 12 !!",
          "so glad it is going well steph and think it will be good for us all to get back to work and normality but as and when we are all ready and depending on what we do. maybe 12 weeks is a bit of a turning point (another jinx \ud83d\ude2b) it does say after pneumonia you will start feeling much better after 3 months and 6 months to fully recover and i still believe that is basically what we have had with a few other symptoms thrown in to the mix - let's pray we are now on the home stretch.lx",
          "thanks lulu, yes defo on par with pneumonia as it's taken this long to feel marginally better. i've got a long list of symptoms and keep adding. i've still got a slight swelling on my upper right thigh , google says its where my lymp vessels are so some things going on there. don't think anyone else has that symptom. enjoy your evenings xx",
          "lulu,which antihistamine are you taking?",
          "loratadine 10mg - very low dose not sure if coincidence but feel much better on the mucus/nasal front - wish i'd started taking them when specialist told me to! he told me any otc antihistamine but my partner takes these so used his.lx",
          "thanks lulu.",
          "hi jim sounds like it's getting abit easier for you at least the sun's out. hope you can get answers at gp . i'm ok thanks just slowly plodding along see how i feel when i go back to work next week. it will be nice to see everyone and be a bit normal.",
          "morning guys,been to the doctors and blood test done.just about to do the spirometer test and i was asked a series of questions.last one being have you had antibiotics in the last 6 weeks. yes i replied.test cancelled.earliest test date 20th of july.hey ho.jim.",
          "that's great you're back at work steph, must be good to be part of the real world again. sorry you've still got all those symptoms, hopefully one by one they'll disappearit must have been good to have your 1st takeaway for a while, lulu, looking forward to mine! maybe i'll try antihistamines if they help with nose problemssorry you can't get your test jim, at least you got blood test though. it's certainly a waiting gamehope everyone has a good day and enjoys the sunshine :)",
          "hi jo,i got home and posted the message you replied too.however, i had just posted and received a call from the doctor asking me to go back.fortunately, i am two minutes from the surgery, so returned.it wasn't my usual doctor but the one who picked up i hadn't had any form of lung tests.i did the first spirometer test, which showed my lungs are normal. as such the nurse asked the doctor to review the first test result. her comment was, i wish my lungs were to that level? in light of that they didn't do the second test, which incorporates a nebuliser containing asthma medication.so just the blood test results to get on tuesday.her passing shot was i'll be referred to a specialist respiratory consultant for further tests etc.oh she's given me some super duper sleeping tablets too!!!every cloud etcjim.",

          "thanks jo.",
          "hi guys,here you are !happy to report i have not had a relapse in 2 weeks, since i started taking the ranitidine actually. been bloody brilliant! so thankful to feel normal again.have some residual mucous and a tiny sore spot low in my left lung but day to day i would now say, 14 week later, and 10 weeks after writing this post, that i am finally more or less recovered.i have had 2 antibody tests, the first at week 11 was positive. the second this week however was negative ( both abbott tests)..what this means, who knows! but my t cells count is still high. still, will have to be careful come next wave. from what's happening elsewhere in the world it looks likely there will be one.glad a lot of us are starting to feel better!",
          "that's brilliant news, so happy for you. :)which symptoms did the ranitidine improve? i think i need to get my hands on some!all the best",
          "hi res,was wondering where you'd disappeared to!i really wanted to know how you got on with the h2 blocker. great news!so happy you're basically back to normal.i've got some famotidine from abroad and wondering if to take...in the middle of treatment with ppi for acid reflux and not sure if to carry on or switch to famotidine. getting very little advice from gp and holistic doc is being very unclear.well done you though!",
          "it helped the tight chest and cough. very glad to be well again!",
          "yeah, advice is so limited on this illness.am glad we have all had each other!i'd give the famotidine a shot if it's the cough and tight chest that is bothering you most as that's the symptoms they alleviate.",
          "i have a sore chest, which is either muscles or acid reflux or both, feel lump in throat which also gets sore. also get muscle pain in back sometimes.don't know if to stick it out with ppi or try famotidine.thought to try famotidine at least for the reflux.had a busy, fairly normal day today actually. chest pretty sore now though but pleased could get on with my day.hope you're all having a good evening!",
          "evening everyone!!wow great news res, that is so good - i think i am about the same recovery scale as you pretty much there but a few pains in lungs but overall so much better - and am sure there will be more improvement to come. it was not an easy journey. i have found antihistamines have helped me with mucus and coughing - funny how we have all had to work it out ourselves and share our information. that is so interesting about the antibody tests my specialist said thought only lasted around 12 weeks max so that is pretty spot on - i had my test around 12 weeks and was negative - surely medical research into this illness are interested in your results?!! how do they test your t cells is that with the same test?i spent the day on beach today making the most of sun before starting back at work next week - feeling nervous about what people are going to say (i know it's stupid) but not having the initial test and then a negative antibody test so many people have said maybe it was \"just\" flu - it makes me want to weep all the explaining i have to do to justify being so sick for 3 months but people seem quite cynical about this illness for some reason as if you are making it up - i know i mentioned this before but i am least hypochondriac person you could meet, never ill but i still get the feeling people don't believe me!anyway glad you had your tests jim and sounds like your lungs are good from the lung function test and am sure the bloods will be fine too. sounds like you are now making progress thank goodness.i decided yesterday i wanted to be \"normal \"again \ud83e\udd2a so ordered a takeaway and then today shock horror didn't disinfect all our shopping delivery - what a relief has been taking ages!! jo you should think about ordering a takeaway this weekend it definitely makes you feel better!glad you are going back too next week susan will be tough wearing a mask but lovely to see all your friends and colleagues, will be a big week for a few of us going to work.where's gary been hiding today? missed waking up to his message, hope he is ok!!lx",
          "by the way, how much ranitidine do you take? are you still taking?",
          "75mg dane...and yes, still taking it. gonna take whole 2 packs.",
          "yeah, i heard that too. don't think antibodies are all they are cracked up to be.t cell count i had in my full bloods so not same test. don't think they have t cell specific serology for covid yet even though they say some people may fight it off purely with t cells and never make antibodies. beach and takeaway sounds lovely!i've been having healthy takeaways but still worried to have pure junk as it was making me feel awful.",
          "yes heard same about fighting it off with t cells. is ranitidine a form of antihistamine? - i googled it and it seems it may be - just interesting that i noticed such a big difference after taking antihistamine and you have with this.i had lost a stone which i didn't need but have happily grazed my way back to my fighting weight. i was same ate so healthily for weeks was petrified to put any junk into body but have relaxed a bit now and back to everything in moderation!lx",
          "afternoon everyone late check in hopefully i'm on the right page had a few good days and it's our 14 weeks anniversary mine lulu and stuart glad you're getting there res that's great news i was until today headache and fatigue better try ratadine hope everyone is well and improving thanks for the message jim was a bit late today gary",

          "hey lulu, ranitidine is a h2 blocker which they use for acid reflux. they did studies in china for moderate covid with an h2blocker which reduced symptoms of cough and tight chest. i've found this to be accurate. glad your antihistamines are working for you!yeah, diet wise i still have weight to lose. the pills the neurologist put me on made me gain 6 kgs in 2 weeks\ud83d\ude31. sadly it's not coming off just as fast as it went on!",

          "only had the tingling at very start in left hand only not for long a day or two and not had it since no doubt will go away again soon. not sure need that much flarin as upsets stomach and throat only sore in eve. my breathing improving but it is not right and still get tightness but not so often. my gp said yesterday start cutting down the mucodyne see how you feel can always increase again. i am going to carry on taking the vit d supplement.",
          "lulu,raab is in no rush to reply is he!i can't wait to hear his spin on the situation, however i will await to pass judgement until his reply.regarding my breathing, it's okay but when i walk my chest will become heavy and tight, which abates on rest.i do quite alot of breathing exercises especially to strength the respiratory muscles and clear mucus.has the flarin eased your chest?have you found anything to help with reducing the mucus? some days i can clear half a cup full on a morning, others much less.sounds like your nearly there though.i've been in contact with our occupational health department throughout and they just keep accepting everything i say and never question sick notes, which is a relief but understandable in the circumstances.they are calling me again in a month for a update.can't see me doing six 10hour shifts this year at the rate i am recovering but they have said they will redeploy me into an office position, which is my idea of torment but necessary.have a lovely day to everyone,jim.",
          "sue,thank you for your kind words.the last 12 weeks has been horrendous for me, as i am positive its been for everyone else too. i consider we have all climbed a mountain to get to where we are now and we have further to travel.we were fortunate to dodge hospital and the ramifications that would go along with that.i now truly believe we will all make a full recovery but there will be a time element of varying lengths, as we will all heal at different speeds etc.your doing really well completing 10k steps a day, well done.have a lovely day,jim.",
          "morning all,lovely to read some positive posts this morning.sounds like things are improving a little for you jim ,you sound more up beat too.glad the beer and curry went down well gary and you got a better nights sleep for it.all sounds like everyone is is getting there with some returning to work too even if it's a different schedule to what you've done before it's a step forward.my breathing has been worse during the heat,feels like i'm breathing in dust,really struggled wednesday night i know it was warm but i had to sit up in bed just felt i couldn't get enough air,chest still feels tight and my throat is not sore but feels dry when i swollow and having to put more effort into it .body still aches too,mostly upper body .smoke smell still there mostly noticable at night and morning.apart form all that still managed some nice walks,just cut down on the distance.my blow has still not improved lulu but considering chest feels worse this week i'm not surprised. consultation with cardiologist which i thought was my actual echo this coming week is now not face to face but over the phone .not sure why this is all taking so long considering a cardiologist already recommended i had an echo when i had my ecg in a note to my doctor.guess i had to be assigned to my own one. had more sharp pains this week so hope they hurry up.hope you all manage to have a nice day in the wind and rain \u2614x",
          "dawn,i feel your angst with these protocols they have in place when your referred to a consultant. logically its nothing to do with the current stated of affairs, as they will have to see you in person at some point and obviously they are aware how long you have been suffering.when you speak to the consultant i would stress the urgency until they make an appointment there and then, if possible.really appreciate you noticing i have improved especially my mood.hope you feel better soon.jim.",
          "hi jim, you're right,i'm just impatient with the long haul,thought i'd cut out the middle man so to speak as a cardiologist was around when i had my ecg and took a look,not to be but i will insist on one promptly thanks jim,have a nice day x",

          "hi garry, i hope that you are getting better. for last few days i noticed an incredible improvement in my condition as well (i hope won't jinx it). since i added l-theanine 250mg aonce a day. maybe it is a coincidence, but maybe it is worth trying. mike he tried it and worked for him, so i decided to do some research and found some studies that it works with cytokines and asthma, balancing them. it is not expensive but maybe it is worth trying? kind regards maciek",
          "hi maciek i was wondering what to carry on taking and what to cut down on to try to give the body a rest i'm taking liquid gold for the vitamins k and d curcumin extract and flarin 3 times a day i am getting migraines but my chest is improving and i feel like the inflammation is as well got tingling still but only in left hand gary",
          "glad to hear that gary! it looks like something does work. i did cut flarin, it is ibuprofen at the end of the day, so have to be careful with it. when i did cut it a lot of inflammation came back, as expected, but started l-theanine and it is amazing. it is an extract from tea leaves and it is used to fight stress, but i found some studies that proved it helps with inflammation. i decided to try after mike mentioned it. it does work for me. bought one on amazon (brainpower nootropics) maybe worth trying? disclaimer: this is not a medical advice, just sharing my experience. kind regards maciek",
          "do you think i can use it instead of the flarin then i can carry on with trying to get rid of the inflammation gary",
          "hi garymaybe cut the flarin down see if you need it - morning and night might be enough - worth a try you can always increase it again?- doesn't sound like you are taking much else and the other supplements probably good for you anyway so no need to stop. maybe go back to normal tea?!! i am still drinking peppermint tea but never used to so may knock that on head soon - i stopped drinking coffee because of heart rate but might go back to that too soon.maciek just suggested something new - am going to have a look at that as reported big improvement - glad you are doing so well maciek am really happy for you - as jim says it has been a horrendous time and i was lucky in that i didn't have family to look after that must be awful if anyone had young kids to look after whilst dealing with this - i can't even imagine.jim so glad you are getting on well. the flarin helps chest and throat i only take it when i need it in the evening and makes the evening much more enjoyable as not sitting here with sore throat! i am not sure if it is coincidence but as i said before the antihistamines seem to have really helped to dry up the mucus - good you are getting all that cr&p out of your body at last - i was pretty much same and it has reduced significantly over last couple of weeks.dawn, agree that hot weather definitely didn't help - never had to worry about weather affecting breathing before but it def does now but hope that is only temporary. i remember when you were recommended the echo you were quite rightly really worried and upset - well the only conclusion you can come to is whatever their reason for requesting it they can't have been too worried otherwise would have pushed it through much quicker than this! glad you are still blowing well - you are jim alike \ud83d\ude02. lx",

          "thanks for the advice maciek, i'm really tempted, it's great that it has helped you so much.do you know anything about hemp oil? i've started taking it, it's supposed to be good for inflammation too, and mentions heart health too",
          "i need to get blowing too!another amazon order coming up..enjoy you evenings everyone, loving this cooler weather :)",
          "hi joanne,> 1. i read about hemp oil and was tempted to go for cbd oil myself. my mum used to use it to ease her pain and it worked greatly. the problem is the price as cbd is very expensive and you have to try it to see if it is for you. start from low dosage. but i know a lot of people who use it on regular basis to fight with chronic pain. it is also anti inflammatory so maybe it is worth trying. i didn't try myself therefore it is hard to say. hemp oil is cheaper version but it is hard for me to say anything about because there are not many researchers who fcus on hemp oil not cbd. hemp oil is not as good and it is hard to find oit where it is from and what it contains. cbd in comparison is well researched cannabidiol and it is easier to find good one and with controlled purity in my humble opinion hemp oil is just a gimmick, but if it works for some people then it is fine. if i don't get better next thing i'll try is cbd not hemp oil, they are two different things from same plant. hope that helpsmaciek",
          "hi joanne,i've just started taking oil,mainly for my anxiety.i've taken it before after a knee op and it seemed to help.hope it helps you.yep amazon must be doing well with all our medical gadgets \ud83d\ude02 x",

          "morning gary,sorry to hear that my pal.i don't know whether inflammation will show up to be honest but wouldn't have thought so.how are you feeling now?jim.",
          "gary,just read this-c-reactive protein (crp) testthis is another test used to help diagnose conditions that cause inflammation. crp is produced by the liver and if there is a higher concentration of crp than usual, it's a sign of inflammation in your body.",

          "i am usually up at this time because sleep doesn't come easily anymore. had 6-7 hours of sporadically intermittent sleep waking every hour or so.well, i've dragged myself out of bed taken a few tablets and done some breathing exercises. nearly passed out doing them. went very light headed!!!!as for how i feel hard to say. i don't seem to be able to get any mucus up today but i can't tell if there is any to remove. this illness is a real pain in the arse.had tingling back in my fingers since yesterday afternoon and the odd pain in the rib area.never ending pal.",
          "with you on both sleep and pain in the arse i've got window open cool pad on my pillow and a fan incase too hot only time i got a good sleep was with the peroni not sure if it works or i paid for it yesterday gary",
          "i would have had the window open but the winds were 25mph plus.as for a beer or two. i would try it but the medication wouldn't agree unfortunately.just had breakfast and watching the tt reruns on ch24.i do hope i can get well enough to ride my bike again.",
          "morning!i know what you mean gary about the inflammation rising think i said had same last week and the roof of mouth and tongue felt inflamed but has gone again mainly although roof of mouth feels bit lumpy still. i always feel none of the many symptoms are far away waiting to rear their ugly heads yet again but every time it seems to last less time. jim i reckon mucus is probably reducing but will come and go for a bit longer i had days didn't cough up anything but then chest got tight and next day i could cough up again but probably good sign it is lessening .i had the lump of mucus at back of throat treat last night which was pretty disgusting - i'm with you guys this really is a big pain in arse it is never ending but it is slowly getting better we must focus on that!good luck with blood tests tomorrow gary.lx",
          "morning lulu dry it is pain in the arse definitely i'm going to just take flarin in the morning and at night with the vitamins and hopefully will kick on from there glad the migraines have gone daenjoy yourself with your brother today i think that's what you're doing today gary",
          "morning lulu,fingers crossed it is reducing because the disgusting sounds that emanate when i'm clearing my chest make my toes curl. everyone else leaves the vicinity post haste, understandably.totally agree positivity is a must. i know everyone has said it to me relentlessly over the months, which has taken some sinking in but you and they have been and are spot on.positivity and sleep i now think are the two main drivers for recovery. have a lovely day.jim.",
          "agree gary, think good idea to slowly cut down on the flarin and also you can take it as and if you need it and it will probably then be more effective so if my throat is sore in evening i take it then - also i feel if i am not taking any medication i can see more where i am in terms of what is wrong and how i'm progressing, as doc said you can always increase again but gives you an idea of progress. i have cut the mucodyne down to 3 a day was taking 6 - at my worst i was taking 16 tablets a day - two of which were supplements! i was taking 8 penicillin on top of the mucodyne.yes off to my brother's today for a bbq - just good to have a change of scene. have a nice day.lx",
          "it's awful, it is so disgusting, really feel for you jim - don't get me wrong i am still coughing up in morning mainly but it is nowhere like it was at its worst. if our neighbours didn't know i had c19 i think they do now!it is hard to feel positive when you feel so ill - i can still get low wondering if this is ever going to end and i will get back to my normal fitness but all i can do is look back at how far i have come in 3 months and think if that continues in another few months hopefully will be there. it was only my son drumming into me how powerful the mind is on the body - he is a great advocate of that - he literally helped me change my thought process - it's so easy to get into negative thinking so am trying hard but it is a work in progress! he also kept telling me to sleep it is the greatest healer - it is when our body/cells repair so the sleeping pills will help you no end.enjoy your day, so glad you are beginning to feel better.lx",
          "hi maciekthanks for your advice on hemp/cbd oil. yes cbd does sound better, not sure about the hemp now, but i got it for the price and it had a lot of good reviews. it doesn't taste very nice though! thanks for your help",
          "gary,hope you've had a good day and fingers crossed for you with the blood test tomorrow.jim.",
          "hi joanne, i just read my message again and it could sound rude, therefore i'd like to explain myself. there is a lot of people reporting about hemp oil that it benefits them with their symptoms, which i think it is a great thing. this virus is new and there is a lot of things we have to learn about it, but it will take time, maybe there is something in hemp oil that helps and i think the most likely could be cbd, which is in a very small amounts available in hemp oil. but who knows maybe there is another component that is in hemp oil that does the trick. maybe it is just psychosomatic. at this stage it is hard to judge. on the other hand cbd oils is a well known and well research cannabinoid and it is proven to work and help with a lot of different symptoms. therefore if i had to i would go for this one. recently i stepped into a very interesting groups that shared researches regarding ''sugar'' it looks like it messes with nervous system a lot that is why we have a lot of symptoms that are neurological, but it is also a reason why our cytokines and most of our defence mechanisms are of the chart. that is why i think l-theanine seemed so effective, well at least for me as it regulates gaba. there is a lot of reserach into vagus nerve function and how it is affected by the virus and a lot of people are trying to reset the system, including me, by using devices called tens. which uses electric stimulation. it is really interesting and if you google it you will see how important it is and how it seems closely connected to all of our problems. we also started using a lot of nootropics to balance brain chemistry like acetylocholine or gaba. it is really interesting and most of the time we are like guinea pigs, but as long as it improves our recovery we'll stick to it. my advice is if hemp oil works for you, you should stick to it, that's what i learned about this illness if something works it means it works. they are not the right or wrong answers. i hope it helps wish you all the best maciek",

          "hi,had 61/2 hours intermittent, so that's good for me these days.it's becoming harder to recollect the halcyon days of a full nights uninterrupted sleep.when you've got the good news let us know.jim.",
          "morning all,i have just finished a telephone conversation/appointment with my gp.my blood tests show no irregularities, thyroid ok, not diabetic, screen for standard illness making tired ok, iron b12 folic acid ok and platelet count normal.all inflammatory markers crt and ecr normal.chest xray and spirometer test normal.referred to respiratory specialist for urgent ct scan as gp considers i may have bronchiectasis, which would show up on a ct scan.bronchiectasis relates to lung damage that shows as excessive mucus production due to widening of areas of the lungs. no cure.hope everyone has a good day.jim.",
          "i'm inpatient jim so i rang the surgery got told off she never saw my finger go up so next time ring after 1 o'clock there won't be a next time i'm changing surgerys as soon as i have a chance all good with the results obviously can't pick the little sugar up so still got inflammation and tight chest to deal with got two weeks before i go back to work so hopefully it will do one your getting somewhere with your sleep jim that's a bonus gary",
          "morning jim that is all really good news. my gp also told me thought i may have bronchiectasis and the ct showed i def hadn't, which in my heart i knew as i had absolutely no problems before, the problems i had were caused by c19 and more than likely you will be the same. there is an article in dm today about a guy who was in icu and now having lung physio - it actually states that his lungs were full of mucus and tells you the breathing exericses need to do. i think the gps have not seen much c19 and the main symptoms are similar to bronchiectasis (breathing problems and lots of mucus) so they jump on that as an explanation for all your symptoms. specialist told me the lungs will heal but will take time. from what i have read bronchiectasis is a long term condition, doesn't happen overnight, so unless you had this as an underlying condition before c19 it is unlikely - my gp scared the pants off me telling me this - very irresponsible imo. i know we are all different and your prognosis could be different to mine but just sharing so you don't have the stress and worry that i had for nothing.lx",
          "so sorry jim i really hope that this may be wrong and its just the virus it's not right that you have been through so much i wish you all the best gary",

          "hi lulu glad you turned up was a bit worried for jim hope your right i got the little irk come back in my throat and my left shoulder feels like it is fractured because i have been leaning on it a lot i suppose weird enjoy your prosecco wet or dry stuff the doctor \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "morning lulu,i full appreciate your reply and i agree. the only way of proper diagnosis is via a ct scan. i said the the gp, once the referral has been sent and there is acknowledgement of such i'll push for a ct.if that doesn't come to fruition i'll go privately for further tests etc.i genuinely consider between all the gp's i've spoken to and involved they have tried to come up with a diagnosis, which is understandable.i am sure i'll be like you lulu with your specialist.on receiving the news i text my friends sister, the icu nurse who said the diagnosis wasn't good but when i told her my peak flow of 620 she was amazed.it's a wait and see situation but as you say its covid damage like yours.jim.ps thanks gary.",
          "exactly jim don't think you'd have a peak flow of 620 if you had bronchiectasis same as i wouldn't have been swimming 50 lengths a few days prior to getting sick but as you say you need the ct scan to fully put your mind at rest but i do think the doctors feel they have to \"label\" what you \"might\" have but then make you wait so long for tests and results to reassure you it isn't that by which time you are terrified. if i had been able to have the lung function test and it had come out well i probably wouldn't have ended up going privately for ct scan but the doctor wouldn't carry out lft at that time as it would have been face to face and it has never been mentioned again by my gp - think my gp just happy i went privately and i am no longer his problem!! every time i ask him something now he says check with your specialist (yep at 200 quid a time!) and would you like me to refer you to ent specialist for your throat - privately of course!lx",
          "lulu,you opened pandora's box when you \"understandably\" went privately for a scan.i've just spoken to stuart and there's a ten week wait in his area currently, which is getting longer due to covid referrals.some gp's take umbrage when a patient goes via a different route and with how little is known about covid they'll happily side step dealing with it. if he attempted to use that course of action with me, i would say i can no longer afford to go down that route and i was their problem again. whether it was true or not. the nhs is for all and free at the point of access!(sorry i'm ranting again).fortunately, a couple or three gp's at my surgery are the caring types.oh, there's an article in the daily mail today regarding post covid referrals, care, recouperation and rehabilitation. sighted in the article are comments by the head of chartered physiotherapists regarding the vast lack of trained personnel especially in regard to the suspected increase required with covid.my suggestion to everyone is get in early for referrals via their gp.just been for a mosey round the block after my lunch. our days are hectic.hope everyone is having a good day.jim.",
          "hi jim, all,thanks for advising about referrals for post covid care. last time i spoke to my gp to suggest follow up care she suggested i take anti anxiety drugs :)think she's fed up of me calling for advice.now 15 weeks, have had a few difficult days, today especially. real problem with muscle aches, extreme fatigue and today dizziness which not had before. almost passed out trying to eat lunch today. so upset. thought i was doing ok. anyone else with fatigue? i can't get a deep breath in most of the time it feels like the muscles too tired.i'm starting to wonder...could there be an anxiety element having such a big effect? maybe the doc is right even if she just wants me off her back!i've got blood test to do but too tired to get out, oh well maybe tomorrow will be better.so happy to hear some of you doing better it does give encouragement.",
          "hi,anxiety and stress have both caused me relapses with fatigue.from what i've read in posts and on the internet it is so easy to do too much, too soon and symptoms kick back in.prime example, 2nd of may after 4 weeks of being ill, i woke up feeling normal. like a blithering idiot i cut both front and back lawns. umm, at least a week in bed.however, i've had days of total exhaustion after doing absolutely nothing.google post covid fatigue and there are some nhs leaflets, which have been produced by area's that are above the curve. there is a break down on exercise, rest, etc. well worth reading.hope you feel well soon.jim.",
          "thanks jim.i can't say i did anything particularly grand to set all this off.the only thing that was maybe a mistake was that yesterday when i was already not too perky i led a zoom singing session for some kids for an hour and felt a bit sore after.i've looked at advice about pacing when you have fatigue but thought at some point you should be able to see an improvement. feel like i'm going in circles!i spoke to my naturopath doc who i'm having a bit of miscommunication with as she thought she told me to start certain supplements but actually she didn't...never mind, least it was a good conversation and someone i can chat to. she told me to get a blood pressure monitor for my fainty spells so ordered that and it should arrive tomorrow.here's hoping this relapse goes away quick!",
          "hi dane , i've also had flu like symptoms past few days. aches and pain and runny nose ,fatigue, just when you think it's getting better !! don't know if it's the change of weather. with regards to mucus i've never had the cough and haven't bought up any but feel it's still on my chest. i've been taking mucus syrup as my gp refused to give me the tablets that lulu takes. i'm guessing i'm full of mucus sorry to be so frank !! that's probs i'm still getting breathing issues. glad you're seeing a specialist jim that's the least they can do after all this time.",
          "my fingers are firmly crossed for you and everyone to make a speedy recovery.it's a fine line between doing enough and doing too much.i think we've all been guilty of thinking we were better or could do more.take care and tomorrow will be better.jim.",
          "sorry you're also having a hard time steph. you'd think by now (15weeks!) there'd be a good improvement.naturopath doc who lives abroad asked if there's been a recent drastic change in weather as it can affect how you feel like you said, i told her there's always drastic changes in the uk...maybe we need to move countries!have a good evening and let's hope tomorrow is better.",
          "thanks jim.yes there's no rush in this.although we need to believe the complete healing will come!i'm going to drink more water and start extra zinc (as per naturopath advice)just had a word with my husband about getting help in the house as i can't look after the kids like this and he's got long working hours. wonder how to go about it in current climate",
          "dane,ring your gp. if they are not aware of your history tell them from a thread to a needle.it may be worth writing down chronologically the events from becoming ill to now. include all your symptoms, gp calls, hospital attendances, ambulance calls etc. also included family circumstances, number of children, ages, schools. what your husband does, his hours etc.then ask for a referral through to social services for assistance at home.they should offer this prior to you asking but be prepared.most of all make sure you tell them everything and your at your wits end and are concerned for you and your family.they are duty bound to refer you.jim.",
          "thanks steph.as soon as i hear anything ref the consultant i'll post what happens etc.sorry to hear your so poorly big virtual hug.",
          "hi dane it's the same as me sometimes i think i feel great and push myself and forget to pace myself and it comes back and bites me but i suppose we just got to try and take the rough with the smooth and turn the corner and hopefully the day will come when it's all smooth it's your immune system i think that's fighting causing the fatigue hope you feel better soon gary",
          "thanks jim,was thinking along the lines of hiring a nanny or a live in help. not sure if this is possible now.i've spoken to my gp numerous times, (she knows i'm struggling, been calling almost weekly) but not mentioned family struggles because until now we've been looking at it as a short term struggle so if things aren't perfect for a bit you can live with it problem is 15 weeks in and i suddenly can't do basics again. will try call tomorrow and see if there's any support available. you're right, there should be.",
          "yes gary i know that's true, but i so badly want to be done with it! the nature of this illness being up and down drives us potty!!!",
          "dane,tell them everything, they should have no choice but to refer.jim.",
          "yes i know you are right dane it's like jim said a right pain in the arse and i really think you have done a great job of dealing with it and a family as well in normal circumstances you should have had help from the start but you are getting there and hopefully very soon gary",

        "content": "hello everyone, well wishes to all those suffering longterm symptoms. i found this forum yesterday and its lightened my heart and mind to see that i'm not alone in my symptoms and frustrations in dealing with this illness. i'm a 24 year old man from ct usa, and i first got infected with the rest of my family over the easter weekend. that tuesday i had body aches and fatigue but nothing else, not even a fever. the next day my airways felt inflamed and burned a bit when i would breath. then on thursday, it seemed to go away and i felt so well that i did my normal cardio routine. that might have been a bad idea though, because that evening i got that feeling of an illness coming on. friday morning, i was congested, and from my nose to the back of my throat felt raw and dry and i totally lost my smell and taste. i had some sinus pressure and fatigue as well. after week or a week and a half, the rawness, sinus pressure, and fatigue went away. i tried exercising again, and thats really when the really long term symptoms started. i've felt very fatigued, my heart feels like it thudding very hard constantly, my chest feels tight like someones pressing on it, and cant breath as deeply in as i used to, feel breathless especially in a mask, and ive got strange feelings in my right lung, sometimes like a tickling feeling, sometimes like a side stitch, usually under my pectoral but it moves around. yesterday i felt it on my left side for maybe the first time. went to an urgent care on may 15, they did an ekg and a cheat xray which came back clean so they sent me home. i started feeling a little bit better (maybe because some of the anxiety was lifted?) and tried exercising yet again; i got through a week before i started feeling worse again. i've been worrying that it has been my exercise causing these relapses but it seems that many people have them without it. like many others have said, the anxiety and depression of this has been the worst part for me. exercise has been my stress relief and leisure for a long time, and being unable to do it has been a huge mental toll. i mean i was doing an hour of intense cycling every day after work and felt great right before the illness. now i get tired during a long but leisurely walk. hopefully it really is just a matter of time, though i'm getting worries before this really is the 11th week for me. maybe the pcp i'm seeing later this week will have some answers.",

          "hi jim and thanks for the welcome. agreed about feeling like we \"dodged\" anything at all. i was so cocky about it all, even when the body aches started, because i was young healthy and fit. its been a very humbling experience, and i echo what others have said about the mental trauma from this potentially taking a long time to heal as well.",
          "i think you exercised one too many times.i'm still wondering about a possible fateful decison i made 2 days after my fever ended. i was keen to get back into my normal routine so i went to the gym and did a light workout. that night the insomnia started and i've been struggling ever since.even today i'm wondering would i still be in this position if i didn't go to the gym on that day.",
          "hi mike welcome as you can read we all have had the same symptoms i'm on week 13 now and slowly getting there fingers crossed but still have that tickling feeling on right side and mucas, gentle exercise like walking might be the best way forward and rest afterwards.",

          "greetings from nj mike. welcome to the club.",
          "hey mike i read your initial paragraph more thoroughly. i am 31 and usually very healthy. i have had that same chest pain, but on my left side. it sounds the same as you described. dull, weird, moving around under the pectorals, like nothing i ever felt before. it felt like i was having a heart attack, but i have also had normal ecgs and xrays. i am just kind of learning to live with it. after 3 doctors saying they don't know what it is but just rest, my fourth doctor finally suggested that it is likely costochondritis, which is inflammation of the tiny muscles behind the ribs. it is common after viral infection. something i tried last monday that has helped was pemf therapy (pulsed electromagnetic field). it made the pain go away for a few days. i am starting to feel it again today so i made another appointment for tomorrow. hopefully a few more appointments doing that will make it go away permanently, because the constant chest pain over the last 2-3 months has been very scary.",
          "thanks rufio. seems like we're both victims of our own exercise ambitions. the fact that i could have done this to myself by not resting for long enough is a bitter pill to swallow. how have you been doing lately? tried exercise at all after that fateful day? i felt well enough physically and mentally to go for a walk yesterday for the first time is a while. it went okay. before bed i dug up and took some b-6 and zinc and today think i feel much less breathless.",
          "all i have been doing as far as exercise is walking the dog for 20 minutes a day. it took a long time to get to just that, and i am still not 100% comfortable. i dropped 30 lbs in two months from being unable to eat so still very weak physically and mentally.",
          "sorry to hear about your struggles, rufio, i know exactly how you feel. especially about feeling like youre having a heart attack. i used to have ventricular tachycardia, and part of these symptoms has been similar fatigue and chest pain as i had then, even though my recent ekg was clean. glad that pemf provided some relief. how does it work? are there pads they put on or is it wireless? maybe ill suggest that to my doctor myself. and ditto about learning to live with it. last couple days ive felt better but not sure if im just getting used to this as my new normal or if its actual improvement.",
          "just don't overdo it yet! i was feeling good for a few days, then went on an extra walk. i am paying for it now.the pemf is two rubber circular tubes that are hooked up to the machine. the tubes are about as thick as a hose. the two tubes connect around your back. you place your arms through each tube and wear it like a jacket. you hold the tubes close to your chest over the affected area. the nurse turns the machine on and you feel the electrical pulses on your chest, about 2-3 pulses per second. the strength of the pulses are adjustable. it should be enough to feel it, but shouldn't be hard enough to hurt. you feel them pretty good at first, but then as your body gets used to it, you barely feel them at all. i did this for 12 minutes each session and as soon as i walked out of the doctor's office i felt a significant improvement. i went again yesterday and as i type this i don't feel the chest pain at all.",
          "i'll try not to! thanks for that description. i actually have a small tens unit meant for muscle aches and such that uses sticky pads. i tried applying it to my chest in various places and maybe felt some relief in the moment but it hasn't carried over to today. im curious if along with the chest pain, have you felt like you're not able to breathe in as deeply as you want to? thats my most annoying symptom, so it would be great if the pemf helped you with that as well.this morning i didnt feel great, but after taking 200mg of l-theanine, a natural extract from green tea that ive taken for anxiety in the past, the discomfort in my chest has really gone down. i took it just a mood booster but it seems to have had a physical effect. might be worth a try. in some posts people have said the same thing about cbd which is interesting.",
          "i only had some trouble breathing for a short time... maybe 3 times and each lasted about ten minutes. i laid down on my front and that helped. also spirometers help with expanding the lungs.",

          "hi ken. thanks for your reply... we, all i can say is that maybe my case was of the 'lighter' variety. i never suffered the severe fatigue, difficulty breathing, endless coughing, phlegm, body aches etc. that most people seem to be suffering with here. but my symptoms were still persistent, weird and constantly relapsing: aweful anxiety, dizziness and shakiness, tingling in fingers, brain-fog, sore throat (upper area behind the nose), ringing in the ears, mild stomach acid issues and achy esophagus, loss of being able to swallow easily (for 2 weeks), smelling weird stuff like cigarettes, tremendous difficulty falling and staying asleep with waking up too early.it began with mild fever, weird achy intestines and waking up in an anxious brain-fog state for a few hours, then completely disappeared for a couple of days... then it happened again, and again and again... and as time went on symptoms kept changing. when i would lay down my mouth would instantly go dry, ears would be ringing and anxiety would soar. had to jump out of bed and go for a walk to try to calm down several times... then again symptoms would recede...and come back - you get the idea.it took about 8-10 weeks for relapses to become further apart (2-3 days to 6-7 days) and at about 12 weeks for symptoms to decrease in intensity. today, at about 14-15 weeks symptoms have all but disappeared. interestingly i can still detect relapsing going on in the background about every 2 weeks or so but they are low-level and aren't affecting my quality of life anymore.as far as \"why did you recover\" - at about week 6 i began taking vitamin d3 (5000iu\\day with fatty meal), zinc (50mg\\day) and vitimin c (1000mg\\day) and i began eating healthier foods like avocados, broccoli, oranges, spinach, etc. - don't know if any of this helped but i'm sure it didn't hurt. i did not add any exercise nor did i take any treatment as the doctors could not find anything wrong. (2 blood tests, ct scan of my brain, and heart test, blood pressure and oxygen level).i think that maybe there are different strains of covid-19 as well as different responses to the disease. as time passes we will have our answers for sure.i hope you continue to recover fully ken. this has been an unprecedented time for many of us.randy."

          "hi lulu,you keep it up! i tell you it's so good to hear that at least some of us are nearly out of this.i have no desire to go shopping in the real shops and i also used to enjoy a bit of retail therapy. it's all online for me, problem is my nearly teenage daughter is begging me to take her shopping...in a and e now, took your advice jim. they've done an ecg and it was thankfully normal. done blood test for d dimer and thyroid and waiting for results which i'm told can take up to 2 hours so getting comfortable in the waiting room.still, this is definitely the quickest way to get results.dr is not overly worried but said we should wait for blood results to be sure.hope you're all having a good day.",
          "hi lulu was doing good it's just had another pop migraine and arms and legs tingling feeling really sick can't believe it was feeling really good yesterday and this morning tight chest came back was going to meet up with my daughter said i was feeling good to her yesterday can't believe it resting now gary",

          "hi lulu,having a relapse today.on the back of four better days i spoke to my gp yesterday for 20 odd minutes on the phone.then popped to the post office and arranged to meet a really good friend from work for a coffee.we sat in our respective cars side by side for half an hour chatting over a flat white decaf obviously.suddenly i felt tired, so made my excuses and drove home.did a lap round the block and rested for the rest of the day.woke up feeling fuzzy and tired with a headache, none of which have improved throughout the day unfortunately.even when i do my breathing exercises my nostrils start to burn and close up.you wouldn't wish this on your worst enemy.been sat with my lad watching tv all day.thankfully he's a patient soul.take care,jim.gary, keep your chin up my pal better days are en route!",
          "dane,i'd avoid shopping.i was mortified yesterday when i went to the post office and costa.i only saw one person with a mask on! i had mask and gloves, dodging passed people who weren't keeping their distance.the lass at costas said it was nice to see someone with a mask on when she served me.i gave her a 30 second precis of my previous three months. she was horrified.i won't be shopping anywhere once i am better.jim.",

          "it's unbelievable how completely oblivious some people are.my sis told me she went to sports direct and there was no social distancing in the shop at all. i wouldn't dare step into a shop like that.just hope these careless people don't spoil all the progress that's been made.having said that, i am impressed some of my local grocery shops and bakeries have been great, one way systems and gloves for every shopper, that's the way it needs to be for now.",
          "hi all found you sorry to hear you've all been suffering must admit after wearing that mask monday at work didn't feel to brilliant yesterday but also might be withdrawal from the diazepam as well not taking anymore. felt better today been for a walk over fields then sat in garden knitting. hope work goes ok for you tomorrow lulu.",
          "out of a and e now.all bloods good, d dimer gone right down to normal which is actually good news.they will write to my gp to refer me for an echo just to make sure and follow up checks for muscle pain.hopefully we'll get somewhere.still feeling quite rubbish but at least i'm a bit reassured.",

          "hi everyoneglad to hear you've been checked out dane - sometimes reassurance is what is needed - i would just like to know what causes all these relapses at this stage? sorry you've had a bad time too jim today, good you are getting out even briefly to meet friends i suppose it is just small steps and glad your son is being supportive and keeping you company. sounds like gary not felt great today either and i definitely haven't felt so good with bad sore throat yet again - just seems no rhyme nor reason for it, it's always seems to be lurking under the surface. good news you have cut out the diazepam susan and glad you felt better today - sounds like you've had a nice relaxing afternoon. thanks everyone for good wishes for tomorrow - it's ridiculous but feel nervous having worked there for 16 years but i think i have lost my confidence a bit with this whole experience and not feeling so good today hasn't helped!lx",
          "hi garry and everyone, thank you for switching to this page, it looks like my tablet freezes when it has to deal with all the scrolling and not able to take part in the conversation. so happy to hear that there is a progress in your recoveries. there is a lot of improvement on my side as well, just starting to week 12.my mucus is almost not existent, which was my biggest problem. still have sensitive lungs, but not like i had before, i continue to protect them, as my doctor recommended to do, to give time for the inflammation to calm down, so they can rebuild. fatiguei still have to pace myself and use a method of one activity and a lot of rest before i start another activity. this way i manage my energy levels and am able to do something all day. i manage to come back to work for 3 hours per day, but it is third week so i'm really pleased with it. you can read about spoon theory fatigue to find out more about it. elevated heartbeat from time to time i have a high heart beat, but someone in the other group gave my a great tip on how to calm it down, so maybe some of you could try it. i don't know why but it does for me. so you have to take a deep breath and hold your nose and try to push the air very hard like you would try to pop your ears on an airplane. until you cannot do this for longer. and watch how your heartbeat goes down. weird? i know. please don't hurt yourself. ;) back paini also have a lung pain at my lower back, at the bottom part of lungs and how i manage to fight it? i ask my wife to do percussion massage on it when i take a deep breath and try to cough phlegm out when lying head down. it really works. from what i read it is caused by mucus that gets stuck in bottom parts of lungs. the best after steam inhalation. chest painmost of the time it is just inflammation of small muscles between ribs and it is very painful, like stabbing pain, stronger when you breath. the best way is to stretch them. what i do i use a large foam roll that i put under my back and roll my back on it, in different positions. so you stretch your chest this way. i know it is painful, but helps, you will see improvement almost instantly or next day. if you cannot leave your bed use pillows under your back and do the same, just stretch this chest. but be careful and if your oxygen drops when you walk for example, compare to when you rest it can mean something else and you should contact your gp. these are my tricks that i use. i hope that you will find some of them helpful. please have in mind these are not medical advises of any kind. i also manage to book an appointment with respiratory specialist, get ready... drum roll... at the end of august. wtf, is it some kind of joke that i'm too foreign to understand? gary, jim how did it go with your appointments? did you manage to convince your gp to pull their fingers out? i'm about to call my tomorrow as i cannot wait 12 weeks since the referral to see specialist. it is crazy. sure he will be excited to hear from me again. ;)",
          "evening lulu yes not good afternoon feel okay now but earlier had a migraine that set off my arms and legs again tingling but also felt really sick not had that bad for ages also really thirsty again good luck with work tomorrow got my fingers crossed for you gary",

          "maciek,my gp has referred me through to a specialist but i did say to him if it was months i would go privately to have a ct scan done.thank you for the summary of what you do i shall be implementing steam prior to percussion.jim.",
          "lulu,tomorrow will be fine!good luck even though you won't need it.jim.",
          "mine said that it is going to be as emergency, so it will take less time and today i found out that it is going to be at the end of august, which is crazy, as referral was done at the beginning of june. i don't know what to do next. will try to talk to them tomorrow and will see. try the steam, but if you take mucolitics do it 1-2hours after you take them, after steam 10-15 min later percussion. my back pain is gone, still comes back sometime so have to repeat it but it really helps me.please let me know how it goes? maciek",
          "will do my friend.",

          "jim i was talking about the exercises in the messages above for the chest pain fatigue and back pain if you have any a good read i didn't realise i've got a little pain in my lower back but like my shoulder i thought it was part and parcel of little sugar gary",
          "gary,i thought they were mucus expulsion exercises.cheers garry,jim.",
          "thanks jo! just dodged a team call didn't want too much attention just want to slip in under the radar!i've had a really sore throat again and head feels fit to burst - i am on a bit of a low as just can't imagine that after 14 weeks you can have the very first symptom still which was a bad sore throat for me.hope all the migraines/headaches improve during the day. i just keep asking myself wtf has this virus done to us - feel a bit low today in normal circumstances pre-covid if i felt like this i would probably have taken day off sick and this is now me feeling \"better\" - it's very depressing.lx",
          "thanks, garyi remember when doc thought my daughter had migraines they gave her medication for them. hope today is better for you",
          "oh lulu,we all know how you feel.this whirlwind of a virus has ripped through us, devastating our bodies.but, as you've seen and many others we are improving however slowly and as such there is a glimmer of hope of a full recovery for all of us.yes, it may be months down the line but we will get there.if it wasn't for our little group, i would have given up weeks ago.everyone has supported each other for over three months now, which has supported my faith in my fellow man.lulu your doing really well, keep going.jim.",
          "hopefully that's a blip lulu and you feel better soon maybe you was right and 18 weeks is the marker i hope not but i'm going to leave work for as long as i can do wouldn't fancy one of these migraines first day back gary",
          "thanks joanne and for you too gary",
          "oh dear lulu, must be hard for you, hopefully day won't be too long and you'll have a few days off to recover. yes can't believe it's taking so long and those symptoms keep coming back. at least we know we're not really missing much out there and going out and doing things that we normally do is still risky. hopefully when we're better things will be a bit more normal. we had a few music concerts booked, which are now taking place next year, so hoping all will be ok by then.best of luck for today x",
          "morning res and everyone,i was also 15 weeks on monday, guess that makes us covid buddies :)had a bit of a fitful night's sleep, kept waking up, this morning feeling a little dizzy but doesn't seem worse than yesterday. going to be really careful to rest today and eat as much good stuff as i can. will ask my sis to pick up kids from school today and maybe entertain them for a bit.hoping the famotidine will do something good for me too!have a great day everyone.",
          "sorry to hear you're a bit down today lulu.you're right we seem to have a new concept of what a better day is nowadays, it's crazy. like being able to sweep the floor means it's a good day!?sore throat was also my first symptom, only had it day 1 and has come back here and there only last couple of weeks. keep your chin up you're doing really well and make sure to rest up after work.",
          "hi everyone, just to say think it's easier if we reply to the last message we don't end up losing anyone is that ok ? glad the a&e was ok yesterday dane , think it's just a case of waiting for sugar to do one !! lulu like the guys say you've done really well even logging on ,don't rush into team calls etc i didn't it's too much for the 1st two weeks. your confidence will come back gradually. take care all xx",

          "hi guys,just received a letter stating my case has been referred to the respiratory assessment service.apparently they will review my case and i will either be contacted by them or re-contacted by my local surgery if they aren't taking my case on. if i haven't heard by the 7th of july, i have to contact them.crikey, i can't believe they won't automatically see me on referral by my gp.confused.jim.",

          "hi jim, just sent you a message. today i spoke about my referral with my gp and i find this very odd that the clinic can refuse a referral and you can end up with your gp. still waiting for my confirmation. i like you just don't get it. maciek",
          "hi,thank you for the links! your a star.i have said to my gp if its a long wait i'll go privately in the first instance, have a ct scan etc and diagnosis.so if they pass me back to my gp that is what i'll do or the time frame is too long.if it transpires there is a diagnosis then they will no choice but to see me.jim.",
          "thanks sue.",
          "hi jim it's like we're fighting a losing battle with\" little sugar\" and the docs !! just keep chasing jim don't get fobbed off our health is precious !! i'm just back from another blood test this one is to show signs of heart failure. i've had the blood clot blood clot one but this is a new one the docs want us to have !! my gp said he's speaking to post covid docs and they are advising gp's on what bloods, and tests they want people like us to have. macie i've picked up some thiamine hydrochloride 100mg from chemist so i'll start taking them to kick this sugar to the kerb !!! fed up with it now !!",
          "hi steph,totally agree with you. our health is the most important thing we'll ever possess.with regard to blood tests, i can't believe there isn't a national protocol in place especially after 14 weeks of lock down and nearly 50k deaths!they couldn't run a pis! up in a brewery. the national incompetence within our government and services is beyond comprehension.i've had in the region of five tests now and the last was the first to test for diabetes, that has a symptom of extreme fatigue.you couldn't write it. it winds me up.sorry for the rant.hope your well.jim.",
          "that is great news, that someone tested your blood. why thiamine though?maciek",
          "i just got refused my referral by lung specialist. i'm done with doctors, enough is enough so far i managed myself and will have to continue to do so. i won't waste my energy on pursuing medical attention. it's a farce. maciek",
          "that's poor maciek, very poor.have you considered re-contacting your gp for another referral?jim.",
          "maciek, yes i've had a few blood tests lately and they've all come back ok. well the thiamine was a mistake as i showed the pharmacy the tablets you and gary were talking about in an earlier message also beginning with t and she gave me these. i've read up on them and they are vit b so guess it won't do any harm to try them !! i'm so sorry to hear about your referral not being taken forward. i know there is an association called pals which deal with medical compliants . let me have a google and see.",
          "seriously, i'm fed up with fighting with them. it took me ages to finally get a referral from my gp and now it is like kick in the face. firstly i've been told that i'll have to wait as my visit will be at the end of august and now i found out that it is been refused. i think i just leave it as it is. as soon as there are flights available to eu and situation will calm down, i'll go private abroad. i lost all the believe that someone will help me here. it is embarrassing the way we've been treated and neglected from the very beginning. at the moment i'll do what i do as it helps so far and will see where i get. but if one day someone would like to sue this government for what they've done to us, i'll be the first one to put my name down. maciek",
          "maciek , i've just checked pals have a phone number on their website please push for a referral it's important we do all we can to fight for our health !!",
          "thank you steph it is very kind of you. at the moment i'm not in the right frame of mind to deal with it, but as soon as i cool down i will do it. it is a ridicules. the tablets that i'm raving about is l- theanine 250mg - it is tea leaves extract and it is tested to work as anti inflammatory in lung infections and since i started using it, my condition really improved. it is not a medical advice, but it is just my experience. maciek",
          "maciek,i feel for you pal and you definitely do not deserve it in any way shape or form. everyone on here can tell the man you are by the way you have helped everyone and passed vast swathes of information to us all. i'm right behind you when you sign to sue these imbeciles.i to am with you on being infuriated, frustrated and angry by their neglect of all of us.it will come out and i for one will have my day when i get the opportunity to speak out.every time i think of the 999 call i made for an ambulance and it never turned up makes my blood boil.they tried to appease the situation ringing me four hours later!right i'm off to calm down.like i said in a previous post, your a star.jim.sorry for another rant today.",
          "oh i've bought some l theanine and its en route.i'll let you know when it's arrived and how it's helping.jim.",
          "thank you jim for your kind words, they really helped. great that you took a leap of faith and decided to try l-theanine i hope that it will help you as much as it did me. because of the nature of this virus i started citocline which is a nootropic, it is a fourth day that i do and my energy level is the highest since this all crap started. will keep you updated if it is because of that or just better day ;) maciek",
          "sorry to drag this up again as you do not sound in a good place maciek but you were referred to a respiratory consultant on the nhs by your gp and he/she has refused to give you a ct scan? just checking i've understood that correctly. so what did the specialist suggest you do next? and what was the point of the referral? did he/she offer to do any tests or were you just fobbed off back to your gp - who let's be honest can do nothing other than listen to your chest pre-covid and now only talk to you on the phone - my gp wasn't even able to give me a lung function test because it would need to be face to face. gp's are just a referral service these days. i am convinced we all know loads more than all the gps put together.feel so fed up today, work was ok but i feel so tired, throat was throbbing and generally felt unwell - huge argument with partner tonight as feel everyone just treating me as if i am fine now (have to keep repeating how unwell i feel) just don't know what the answer is - feel like i need to take myself away for a few months to see if i fully recover and not impose my misery on anyone else because it seems no-one is that interested all have too much going on in their own lives and this has dragged on for so long. i know it is just a bad couple of days but hard to see that when you are in the midst of it and don't understand why the symptoms keep recurring - what is causing it?one of my colleagues asked how i was and said \"oh you weren't tested, i wonder if it was covid?\" another said \"maybe it was a bad cold/flu that got on your chest\" - yeah maybe \ud83d\ude44 what's the point of trying to explain this to anyone?lx",
          "i know how you feel. i stopped saying it was covid, i simply say it was a bad chest infection and now have complications, it is easier for them to deal with it. i'm fed up with explaining lack of accuracy in testing and all the rest why do i know it was the virus. i was referred to a specialist respiratory clinic by my gp and they refused the referral and i'm back to square one, with my gp. that's all. in 12 weeks i had one x-ray and seen my gp twice with all the advice he gave me was rest, drink a lot of fluids and if you have fever take paracetamol. i feel like i could send him few articles so he maybe could educate himself, but he is so arrogant and with i-know-best attitude that i simply cannot be bothered. now i just continue with what i do. maciek",
          "so sorry you're feeling rough, lulu, you've achieved a lot this week, going back to work while still recovering from this awful virus. hopefully next week will be better, after you've had time to rest. i think we need to ignore what people say and look after ourselves. we know what we've had and they can't understand unless they've had it themselves.hope you're feeling better soon, you've been so supportive and helpful to us all on this forum xmaciek and jim, that's awful the way you are being treated. surely a referral is just that, and it can't be refused?? unbelievable!",
          "thanks so much jo for all your encouragement , maybe i've expected too much of myself last few days - just keep thinking i am better when i am obviously not. really hope you are getting on ok and making progress. good the blood tests were ok - we all seem to be fine on the blood tests - hope you are not still on the aeroplane! - i know exactly what you mean my nose, ears, head feel the same as if you are in a pressurised environment. i am taking maciek's approach and just saying i have complications after a chest infection - way simpler, thanks for that tip maciek and i really feel your frustration - i keep thinking maybe i'll ring gp about throat but then think what is the point?lx",
          "you are very welcome. i know that it is sad that people don't understand what we've been through, but how would they, it is new virus and everyday they are bombarded by hundreds of contradictory information. but i don't feel like educating them would change anything, i have to focus my energy on recovery. i know exactly how you feel, been back at work myself was nothing but disappointing, people think that because you are back it means that you can perform at 100 percent even if you are there limited hours and we'd love to be, but we simply can't. it looks like it wasn't my day today, but not symptom wise but mentally draining. but hey ho we all have these days sometimes when nothing goes right, but if nothing goes right sometimes you have to go left and i think i'll try this tomorrow ;) maciek",
          "wise words thanks maciek for your support.lx",
          "thank you lulu and good night, tomorrow is another day ;)",
          "hi lulu, sorry to hear you're feeling down. like joanne said you've done really well starting back to work and retail shopping in the last few days big achievement !! i've been feeling really congested too, flu like symptoms , it's never ending. maybe that's the way this virus acts , the symptoms we started off with comes back at the end !! i've been keeping a low profile since starting back to work as want to escape questions about why i've been off.....hope everyone has a good nights sleep xx",
          "thanks steph and everyone for support, i will bounce back tomorrow - and agree i am keeping a very low profile at work just fed up explaining it all. hope your symptoms ease again and we are back to gary and my theory that maybe c19 reverses back up respiratory tract and pops out of mouth - remember that conversation \ud83d\ude02 let's hope \ud83e\udd1e take care,lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone looks like i missed a night and a few doubts we all knew ages ago that it is definitely this horrible little sugar raising it's ugly head and we have all come this far without the help and support we should have had months ago and didn't get i think lulu the doubters are not even worthy of you after everything we all have been through my ex had a pop at me yesterday i thought you was getting better when i had a relapse and i just said to what i was 14 weeks ago i am so i said see where i am in 4 weeks if i am not back to my normal self then i was wrong what i am saying is try to get back up again and put a finger up to anyone who doesn't believe or know you and everyone on here is willing us all to get through this horrible situation together i've given up with my gp as well and if i have any more bad relapses am going to a and e because i feel that they will not be busy and will be able to tell me exactly where i am at because they should have had a lot of people recover by now and will know where i am at the sweats have gone at nights but i feel the inflammation is still there headache not so tired as the last couple of days can't shake off the chest and tingling still popping up i am hoping that you all feel a bit better today also because we are so into this situation what i feel would help if anyone knows doctors or nurses that work at the hospitals and people are still recovering to let us know i don't personally know anyone who works at the hospital near me but feel there probably is because i haven't heard that all the hospitals are empty of covid patients gary",
          "morning gary,how are you my pal?did you leave your ex on speaking terms, after she questioned whether you are still poorly?jim.",
          "morning jim we actually get on better now she is my ex its just when i go over with the kids she sees me as normal pretty much but knows i've been ill and thinks like everyone else i am better i've got family that when i was first ill would be texting or phoning but now nothing not that it bothers me i'm just like all of us hoping to get over the line where i am better i don't worry about them anymore if they text or call i will answer how i feel i'm not going to lie they still feel the tests and everything is accurate and i don't have it i don't care gary",
          "i feel your pain gary.originally , i was contacted everyday by friends and family, however that has petered off exponentially.these days i have one pal that texts everyday and a couple every other day.my brother hasn't replied to a text in two weeks.as for here, if it wasn't for my son i would have crawled out of here.hey ho, onward and upwards.jim.",
          "that is support in itself jim your son my daughter has been a godsend listening to me i rang her after i got back yesterday and apologised she saw i was not right and said stop apologies dad it's fine i am just glad you are ok now that's what you need gary",

          "just got up to get some breakfast got pains in my back never had that before anyone else lower and middle might be because i laid on my side all the time because my shoulder does feel stiff sometimes as well gary",
          "after your breakfast i would get in a really hot bath and soak for half an hour.if you've the energy after that try and stretch out your back and shoulder, gently.",
          "cheers jim will do gary",
          "hope it works dane! fingers crossed.hope you got a good rest.",
          "i know when i was first diagnosed with m.e the on and off sore throat every morning was a key feature. maybe it's just part of the post viral you need to be patient with.unless of course you think it's another infection?sorry it's so tough.",
          "yes gary, the tingling for me only started with covid as a migraine symptom but i hear is common for many migraine sufferers ( myself now included unfortunately.)before covid my migraines were much more straight forward nausea/throwup type but no i have proper aura since covid.",
          "thanks res i for some reason have had them a few days also tingling but i had the same problem before and they went so just grin and bear with it hope you are still well gary",
          "i've been brilliant since the rantidine to be honest.get a bit tired sometimes but i've had m.e in the past so i know a lot about pacing and have naturally done that again in the recovery process which i think may be why i'm now starting to improve more.",
          "that's what i need to hear gives me the push i need to get over the line gary",
          "hope you're all doing ok today.i've had headachey feeling last few days like some of you, felt it in the eyes as well which were hurting when trying to focus and making me dizzy. my sis came over yesterday and she was sitting in front of horizontal lined curtain blinds, i had to tell her to sit somewhere else because they were hurting my eyes. she said her migraines are always like that. new for me.on a positive note have felt a bit better today than the last few days, not getting hopes up it will last but grateful nonetheless.anyone who sometimes struggles to get a deep breath in like me, i've just discovered if you tilt your head back when trying it really helps.i've also a lump in throat probably from reflux. gaviscon is my new friend.trying to pace myself so don't overdo it on the good days. it is encouraging to hear that you're doing well res. hopefully more of us will join soon!",
          "hi dane it's been having a pop at me last couple of days migraines and trying to stay hydrated the inflammation feels like it's come up to my throat back of my head was really hot but i feel ok no tingling when i get that it does make me feel sick i use gaviscon as well i'm the same as you i'm hoping we are turning some sort of corner you should be proud of yourself dane i would have struggled to look after all your family and deal with this well done gary",
          "hi resi definitely have an ongoing problem with sore throat i am probably going to have to go and see an ent specialist but have a feeling they will say it is inflammation as that is what it feels like. i was thinking i feel like i would imagine it is like if you have been in a fire and inhaled smoke - anyone else resonate with that feeling? - throat feels tight, dry and raw this was the exact same feeling i had in my lungs and chest but that seems to have improved now so maybe it is time. my friend also suggested i have been doing too much now my breathing is a lot better - which is also a good point i need to pace myself better.glad you are getting on ok. enjoy the weekend.lx",
          "thanks gary for the encouragement. i have very much lowered expectations of myself, so housework is very minimal for me but i have managed to book in a cleaner for 6 hours on tuesday so that will definitely help!sorry you've had trouble with migraines it can really put your whole day off. hopefully these symptoms won't last long. i think as we get stronger they'll slowly (ever so slowly!) fade away. we need to have a party when we all get better and this group closes that will be cause for celebration!",
          "hi danehow you doing? that is a good tip just tried it!! my breathing is so much better last couple of weeks i have to remind myself of that when i'm moaning about my throat!!i get a lump from the mucus in back of throat and i think gary has had that too. i noticed yesterday my eyes were aching when i moved them - was a bit worried as sometimes get that with a temperature but not so bad today.amazing you've been through this with 4 kids - i too can barely look after myself it must have been so tough or looking at the positives maybe you've had some much needed distraction from this sh&t show!yep definitely need to pace ourselves but every time i feel better i rush in and overdo it!anyway, enjoy weekend.lx",
          "just gotta keep fighting you can count me in for the celebration i'm dreaming of beating this hopefully without going to a and e again need a few good days and to stay good hopefully this eases today my heads not feeling well gary",
          "i'm definitely up for a celebration once i'm over this sh-t.but only if i can bring my ferret and greyhound. lol",
          "nice one jim as far as i concerned you can bring whatever you want better meet outside the zoo though \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "dane,i'm so glad you have some help en route.after reading your posts i cannot believe how you have managed with four children and this illness. i am so impressed.the problem with this sh-te when you feel a little bit better it's easy to get sucked into doing a bit more. i'm not saying you have but it's imperative we take it easy at all times. cr+p but unfortunately unavoidable.",
          "bless you pal!i'll have a drink anywhere, it's been 13 weeks so far.not been this dry for 30 years, if not more.what's the beer like down your neck of the woods?",
          "i'm the same as you jim i had a couple of bottles of peroni in 15 weeks i think we should all meet up somewhere we can bring a drink and have a good chat and laugh gary i'm not sure about a pub till they have sorted it",
          "crikey no pubs for me gary.all this reducing the distance and reopening shops scares the life out of me.my nose started to run a couple of hours ago. now i'm worried whether i've a cold or been reinfected.",
          "i'm pretty sure that you have not been reinfected jim you probably just got a runny nose how about when it's all over we have a meeting with everyone at hyde park say like lulu mentioned september we could bring our own drinks and arrange something for the summer gary",
          "if i'm better i'll drive down.",
          "you will be jim im hoping we all will be and i would love to be able to meet up and thank everyone gary",
          "hi lulu,it's funny how you can discover ways to help yourself. glad it works for you as well.so i also have the mucus at the back of throat but then i also have the reflux which can give the lump so don't know which it is or maybe it's both.have already overdone it today, seem to never learn!",
          "me too pal.",
          "thanks for your kind words jim have had a few meltdowns can't pretend been brave the whole time, but in a way it has sometimes been a distraction having to sort my kids out and i would probably have stayed in bed all day some days if i didn't have a reason to get up. i've just told lulu, i've already overdone it today, started feeling fainty so lying on my back. pacing seems to be a challenge for me!",
          "it's unlikely any of us can get reinfected at this point as our bodies have learnt how to fight off the virus. some countries are doing immunity cards for those who have already had it. so wouldn't worry too much.",
          "your welcome dane.it's just hard and a drag.",
          "gary, jim, everyone, it would be great to meet once this nightmare is over. today i phoned my gp and he hanged up on me. seriously, when i ask him what are we going to do now when i got refused referral, he said that not much can be done. so i ask him if at least he could refer me for ct scan, he said that gps cannot do that only specialist can, i said if he could send me this in an email he said that his word over the phone is as good as in writing and bye and he hanged up. wtf? literally. later some other gp phoned me from this surgery and she said that she will refer me as an emergency case so it cannot be refused and should be quick. which is great, but as soon as i get better i'll move heaven and earth to find the way to punish this prick. so that is my day. i don't know what is going on with this whole system? tomorrow is beginning of week 13 for me, champagne anyone? ;)",
          "maciek,your telephone conversation sounds unbelievable, however with the state of affairs currently i'm not at all surprised.i hope you have the gp's name but if you don't i would call reception after you've had your referral authorised and ask for his details.a carefully worded email to the practise general manager will ruffle his feathers.i'm so pleased your going to be seen by a specialist and have a ct scan.jim.",
          "hi all,just been reading through to catch up and its teared me up to be honest ,its amazing to read all the support for each other.great to hear you are back at work lulu even though it sounds like you're struggling, bless you .you'll get your confidence back soon i'm sure .sorry to read you've had a rough few days too gary hope it's short lived.defo up for a celebratory drink after this !\ud83d\ude0a jim you need to get well for this one\ud83e\udd1e.good to hear that you are getting your scan maciek great news...but what disgusting behaviour form gp ..shocking.had a bit of a relapse week ,became very anxious and stressed saturday night,missing a whole nights sleep (relationship blip,but now sorted) and another full day stressed it really set me back.chest sore ,breathing worse ,headaches ,felt like i'd gone back 2 weeks !pleased to say feeling much better today but still exhaused.had a telephone consultation with cardiologist yesterday morning and he is now sending me for an urgent ct heart scan should be within 2 weeks and also an echo.still getting sharp pains in my chest and even though i had tests and echo last year when i was diagnosed with bradycardia as he rightly said we don't know what going on at the moment with you.i did ask if my lungs would show up too and he said that yes damage to lungs would show ,felt quite relieved about this.so my week got a bit better after such a bad start,just feel quite emotional still.hope you all manage to have a lovely weekend x",
          "you too dawn.jim.",

          "hey just see your message. i have also found getting referred is practically non existent. i have been forced to go private. if you need to be seen i would recommend private as even those are a little waiting list. my wait was 4 weeks. hope this helps",
          "thank you tara, but this crap cost me already over \u00a31000 and to be honest if i had a budget i would do this, but \u00a3800 for ct and consultation is kind out of my reach. i'm a freelancer and out of work for over 4 months ;( but thank you for the advice i hope that you are getting better? maciek",
          "hi dawn,sorry you've been suffering too, good you're feeling better and managing to get heart scan and echo. hope you don't have to wait too long, it's really reassuring to have these tests. hope you had a more restful day, lulu, and you're feeling better.good idea, gary and jim, party in the park, finding it hard at the moment to imagine being totally recovered in september, but hope i'm wrongdane, i admire you too, looking after 4 kids whilst fighting this virus, i'm so glad you're getting some help and support.maciek, that doctor deserves to be reported, hope you manage to get your ct scani've been really tired today, headache on and off, still worse after going up the stairs for some reason, and it's like a cold around eyes, ears, nose, and lots of mucus(sorry!)have a good weekend everyone :)",
          "i have had good weeks and bad weeks. this week hasnt been very good. what did your ct scan come out as ? was all ok?yeah i understand it's so expensive. it's so backwards that the nhs have basically stopped working. really dont understand it.",
          "you too jo.jim.",
          "thanks joanne,hope your headache eases with some rest and you feel brighter tomorrow x",
          "what are your symptoms? which week are you in? the system is broken and you'll understand when your gp asks you if you would like to go private. it happened to me and i think someone else here as well. i didn't have a ct, because i don't know if i need one because no specialist had seen me. all the money i spent on private consultation with doctors abroad, medicines and supplements and air purifier and n95 masks to be able to breath, just to name few as lung was my main problem and i don't want to start steroids treatment, well not yet. and my gp advised me to take paracetamol when i have fever and rest and eat chicken soup. ;) most of other symptoms are gone and i'm with hypersensitive lungs to dust, was to almost everything so there is an improvement. i'm pretty much back to normal, just want to see what is the damage to my lungs done by the virus and to see if there are not clots and other hidden issues lurking behind and waiting to kick me in my backside.maciek",
          "thank you joanne, i know that he does and i will do this as soon as i recover. i'm sorry that you are feeling tired and have headaches. try salt steam inhalation for mucus it looks like it seems to help a lot of people. i hope that you have a lovely weekend. maciek",
          "dear dawn, that is great news that you are getting help and i hope that you won't have to wait too long for your ct scan. wish you a lovely weekend. maciek",
          "hi jim, oh i have his name, as soon as i'm in the right frame of mind i will do that. i'm not going to leave it as it is. i have a little bit more mucus today, but it is caused by the new n95 mask that i think is fake as it feels different and as soon as i started dusting in it mu lungs reacted. it took few hours for them to bounce back. any plans for the weekend? hope that you feel ok today? maciek",
          "maciek,there's plenty of fake ppe floating about. my pal at work told me how they had pallets of fake stuff delivered by a reputable supplier! i'm a bit under the weather pal. started with a runny nose this afternoon and a lump in the throat.steph replied that she had it too for the past few days. someone else mentioned it too, i think it was either joanne or dawn.must be a throwback fir the bloody virus.keep well pal,jim.",
          "it is crazy with this ppe as i bought mine at the same chemists as always do, when i spoke to them they were very apologetic and refunded me money, but they said those are the only ones they can get. i have the same lump in my throat from dust or pollen, and in my case it is simple allergic reaction from what my doctor from abroad said. the throat swells slightly that is why it happens and feels like lump. well at least to me. sounded as reasonable explanation so i stopped worried about it. i know it is annoying and uncomfortable, but it comes and goes. hope that you will feel better tomorrow and that you'll have a lovely weekend. maciek",
          "hi dawn sorry you've had a bad week - unbelievable that we are all having these set backs still - i genuinely thought up to tuesday this week i was nearly over this but rest of week has been absolute rubbish. as res said i think it is the pacing yourself which is key so it makes sense when you feel better you end up doing too much and then have a relapse but if you are like me (and dane!) you never learn from the mistake! glad you have a ct scan booked dawn that will reassure you as sure things will be fine. i feel quite emotional too - think we are all a bit battle weary fighting this and worn out. maciek, so good you have eventually managed to have the ct scan approved - definitely need to make a formal complaint but not whilst you are still in their hands maybe \ud83e\udd28 remember i wrote to domonic raab well i have received a copy of a letter which dominic sent to jo churchill who i think is the health under secretary - i'll see if i can paste it into a new post so am now waiting for her to reply - my brother had to chase them up.would love to meet up with everyone we could all guess who is who when we meet - how fun would that be?!! hope all the headaches, ear aches, sore throats, breathing issues \"do one\" as gary would say for the weekend!!take care everyone,lx",
          "thank you lulu, i think it would be wise to wait with complaints. ;) would be lovely if you could post this letter, please. let's hope that it will help to change something or at least put more light at cases like us, for the future generations :) have a lovely weekend. maciek",
          "that made me smile guessing who each other is \ud83d\ude02 i've already got my picture of you in your gloves and mask ...would be fun though.have a lovely weekend away lulu just the medicine you need at the moment..oh and the prosecco \ud83d\ude09 \ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udd42 have fun x",

          "morning early birds went to a and e again yesterday had a breathing problem apparently i've been having anxiety issues brought on by the little sugar i had it about eight weeks ago it was different then because apparently a lot of stress is related with what is going to happen next and not eating much i was having migraines which brought on the breathlessness and drinking lots and tingling of hands and legs not being able to think straight got to ring the gp monday for a prescription have a good weekend everyone mines going to be interesting gary",
          "gary,so sorry to hear that pal.couldn't they prescribe you something there and then?jim.",
          "morning jim it's actually helped me because i finally got a doctor who understood i told him about my sweats my breathing coming up to my throat and about the tingling in arms and legs and the really bad migraines the length of time i've been ill for he gave me omeprazole and asked me about my surgery and i laughed he smiled when i told him said i would have to ring them to get the prescription on monday gary",
          "really sorry to hear that gary but know where you are coming from every time you feel something going on in body especially something different it causes anxiety and then there is the continued anxiety as to whether this will ever go away and you can get on with your life. hopefully they checked you out and in some ways if caused by anxiety at least you know that now. please take care try and eat properly even a softly boiled egg and soldiers with marmite (love it or hate it!!) is a balanced meal (just had that for breakfast and it was delicious that's why it sprung to mind!!) and look after yourself, take it easy, hopefully you will have some company this weekend and your daughter can come over and cheer you up.thinking of you,lx",
          "yes not much sunshine around here either! we are just leaving for the suffolk coast and looks like we are going for about 6 months!! sore throat seems a bit better this morning but i can tell it is lurking under the radar - it feels like it will be back before too long!! am going to try hard not to talk too much and see if that helps but not sure i can go through life not talking it is one of my great pleasures!anyway what is that saying about a change is as good as a rest so am focussing on that for time being.have a relaxing day everyone, lx",

          "sorry tried to copy the letter to jo churchill but it is a pdf and the privacy settings on it won't let me. it basically reiterated what i said in my letter to dominic about the recovery time of 2-6 weeks being totally inaccurate for many people who would be considered mild cases as not hospitalised and employers need to be made aware of this by government and that we are not receiving support/follow up from our gps and have just been left to our own devices.as i am typing and thinking how ill we have all been it is pretty shocking. i know some people's gps are better than others but mine, i have to say, has been pretty useless.will obviously let you know when she responds. lx",
          "sounds like the a&e doctor was on the ball.did they do any tests gary?hopefully come monday morning your gp will review the a&e doctors findings and becomes more helpfully.have a good day pal.jim.ps missed your early morning update today.",

          "hi joanne, thanks prompt that you're all on page 69 and me posting on 70 !! yes i think the cold/flu symptoms are part and parcel of this \"little sugar\" hopefully it's the final symptom before it finally does one !! works been ok as i'm on a phased return and working from home. how's you doing ? xx",
          "yes thinking about it jim what we was going through i didn't know what was happening it makes sense now i will still change my gp anyway as far as i am concerned they done nothing for me sent me ear drops and sent me for one blood test in 15 weeks gary",

          "sorry you have been so unwell, gary, hope you're feeling better now they have checked you at a&e. can't believe they didn't give you medication they say you need. maybe ring emergency doctor if you need it sooner. i'm taking omeprazole, and it's really helping, it took a week or so to work properly.i tried meditation on youtube for anxiety, i hadn't tried it before but it's really calming. and i've got my rescue remedy too. i'll try anything! after what we've been through we certainly need ithope things get better for you soon",

          "we are just back from dinner in restaurant!! - felt so good to be out and actually felt very safe - socially distanced and all the staff wearing masks and touch paid - was four of us so all paid a 1/4 - to accommodate the 40 pound limit. took a couple of flarin before i went so felt pretty ok just hoping don't pay for it tomorrow as had a few glasses of wine \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2cstaying in a fabulous house overlooking the sea, feels like home from home and so good to be away. hope everyone ok and you all had a good day today.lx",
          "hi lulu, it's sounds blissful and relaxing you can't beat hearing the sound of waves. bet you feel proud of yourself we've all come along way. glad the restaurant was a good experience it gives you confidence to go out and to feel normal life again. hope you haven't got a hangover lol \u2764\ufe0f",

          "hi jimmy breathing varies, at the moment i can usually walk for 20 mins, maybe with a few stops if neededi don't know about that site then, depends when they assess you. it says you can have up to 12 weeks aftercare after that. i expect the gp has to refer you ....",

          "morning gary/jim & everyone!how are you all doing? hope the omeprazole helps you gary and jim the mucus is improving. i've had the sore throat since last weds it seems to have gone today but woke in the night feeling very heavy chested and a full of mucus again today - feel very chesty - not sure which i prefer the sore throat or mucus! i am still a 91/2 no real improvement this week - there is no logic to the good days and bad days - i've tried to analyse what i did on the good days and what i did on bad days and can't find any common denominators there is no rhyme nor reason to any of it.lx",
          "hi lulu,firstly, thank you for your support.as i've previously posted this morning i have done too much today.the result being i'm shattered, nose has blocked, the rash on my chest/temperature of my chest have increased.my relapse is self induced!i even fell asleep between 11-12!i've had to cancel my test this afternoon unfortunately.hooe you improve soon.jim.",
          "rest up jim you will get there at your own pace this virus has knocked us all for 6. now china has the bubonic plague this year is def not one to remember.",
          "that is really good news susan! must be tricky wearing the mask i wore one in a shop today and couldn't wait to take it off.how much mucodyne are you taking jim? i was taking 6 a day now down to three but wonder if need to take more again - i am just fed up not knowing what each day will bring - no two days are the same. i felt the mucus building in back of throat in the night and now feel like it is in my lungs especially my right one. lx",
          "hi lulu,yes, i am currently on six per day but once these are taken i am down to three per day.lulu some days i can get mucus up others i can't it's horrible.as per my doctors request i have just called my hospital, as i hadn't received an assessment call to see a specialist. their reply was, you've been triaged and your on the list but there are no appointments at the moment and i can't tell you when it'll be. they'll call you. looks like i'll have to contact my doctors for a private referral.i wonder why they are no appointments?jim.",
          "hi everyone :)yes it seems to be different things every day, lulu. yesterday was the mucus and tight chest, today back to headache and pressure in head, and tingly hands on and off to add a bit of variety. like you say, no reason for it all. hope you manage to clear it but it could just disappear tomorrow.sorry you're having problems with doctors jim, don't know what's going on there, are they really that busy?hope you're having a better day gary, and you managed to get hold of your doctorwell done lulu and susan on 9+, that's really goodi think i'll go up to 8 as i'm doing a bit more and seem to have more energyenjoy your evenings",
          "jo,your sounding on the up with an eight. i am keeping my fingers crossed for a higher number on the old scale.with regard to my hospital referral, i understand there will be redeployment of staff due to the pandemic, possibly illness and self isolation.however, every time i've been to a&e or x-ray department they've been by in large empty.the news has reported the hospitals are empty due to people not going due to the virus, as are local surgeries.my first thought is it's due to the original illness. cynical i know but i can't think of another reason.i've a doctors telephone appointment in thursday at which time i'll ask to be referred to a private consultant.i've come round a bit since lunchtime.hoping everyone a good night.jim.",
          "morning all,bit late with the scoring this week but i'm going to say an 8,been plagued with headaches this week and chest has been tight again,dry mouth but getting better.good to see some of you seem to be improving but sadly some of us are still on the snakes and ladders game \ud83d\ude29.off for my heart scan today.hope you all have a good day x",
          "dawn,good luck for your test.i'm sure it'll be fine.jim.",
          "thank you jim ,don't over do it today x",
          "morning everyone!thanks jim on the mucodyne i am now taking 3 so will carry on - it seems a bit better today not that awful woolly chest - nothing has changed other than i cooked dinner for friends here last night and drank half a bottle of prosecco - maybe that is the answer?! as you said jo it just seems to change from day to day and glad you are feeling things have improved and gone up to an 8 - think that is the crucial thing we just need to see progress and less set backs. exactly as dawn says its like snakes and ladders and why it is such a problem to try and explain it to anyone if they ask the dreaded question \"how are you?!!\" do they want to know how you are today? this morning? this hour? the last ten minutes! it can change by the time you answer them!!good luck with heart scan dawn let us know how it goes and jim maybe the answer is private, it definitely shouldn't have to be but seems only guarantee of getting the scan done sooner rather than later. where's gary? hope you are ok gary.lx",
          "lulu,i have decided to see a private consultant but have to wait to speak with a gp for a referral.however, i have a telephone appointment on thursday, so hopefully i should see some movement shortly.feel tired today, i have just spent an hour on the phone with occupational health. my back and ribs are hurting, possibly through wretching trying to get mucus up.on top of that i feel a bit sick and cold.jim.",
          "hi jimas soon as you have the referral you should get appointment quickly i only had to wait a few days - wonder if you will get a face to face with specialist be good if you can - i have heard some are now doing this rather than telephone appointments - maybe ask this when choosing your specialist.i feel sick when the mucus is bad - very nauseous. it is all so wearing and no answers to any of it - have seen a lot online just watched richard quest on cnn describing how he had mild symptoms but just can't shake it off. hope the day improves jim and you start feeling better.lx",
          "thanks lulu.i'll keep everyone in the loop with the referral and specialist etc.i find the mucus a real quandary, as some days i can get it up in tablespoon quantities, again and again. other days as much as i try a teaspoon is all i can manage.take care.jim.",
          "hi joanne was just checking in and read your message and i had the headaches and the tingling hands and the doctor at a and e said i was suffering with anxiety i'm not certain but i would check it out just in case gary i've been trying to sort myself out and have been taking omeprazole kalms from my daughter l-theanine and listening to meditation music on utube went to work today doctor said get back to a normal routine was good because i walked a bit and it calmed my tingling till i got home and went to the shops got stressed out but back now little tingling sure it will take a few weeks to ease so gotta get on with it i really hope you all have a good few days gary",
          "hi everyonedid you go to work to work gary or just to check in ?just a quick update ,had scan today and unofficially she can't see anything that stands out but its yet to be analysed but took away some anxiety. have to say she was absolutely fantastic and spent about 20mins talking to me after.a good friend of hers a doctor is also a long hauler and she got out her phone and was showing me podcasts this dr had done and how she has contacted as many people in the right places she can to make them aware .she said how they are now seeing lots of long haulers and that at least a lot of doctors are now becoming aware and doing refferals.the dr is jenny judge if you google you'll find a coronacast if anyone is interested, she did that a few weeks ago but was told today since then shes spent a few days in hospital with severe cystitis (i'm sure that's what she said) but and interesting listen . x",
          "i will have a look at that dawn i went to a and e on friday night and have been told that i'm suffering from anxiety and depression so they gave omeprazole for the acid that was coming up and told me to ring my doctor monday my doctor gave me nothing to help just said that the best thing to do is get back to normal routine so i went back to work today suffering now but no fatigue so will see how it goes got the headaches and tingling gary",
          "hi gary,back at work. well done pal, that's brilliant!did it go alright?jim.",
          "good news dawn!the lass that preformed the test if she wasn't sure.nice to hear you've been looked after.jim.",
          "it was tough jim but my work mates really helped me i didn't have to worry about doing anything physical so it was harder talking and writing and remembering dates names times etc got there nothing physical tomorrow so if they they ease me in i should be ok all the walking round the park etc really helped me gary",
          "oops.need to proof read.the lass that preformed the test wouldn't pass comment if she wasn't sure.sorry.",

          "gary that's great you're back at work, take it very slowly, and keep resting afterwardsgood news, dawn on your scan, it must be such a reliefthere's been more on bbc news about long haulers, i didn't see it but i read about it,they're becoming more and more aware.hope everyone ok",
          "cheers jim i personally would love to see the back of 2020 and i feel another couple of months hopefully everyone who has gone through this nightmare new years eve will go thank god that year is over and can get on with some sort of normality you keep going jim i will look forward to seeing you soon mate gary",
          "agreed on all points gary.look forward to seeing you too.jim.",
          "hi gary good news about you starting back to work. just listen to your body if it feels right go with it. if it dosen't give into it and rest. i'm finding work's been ok but doing shorter hours defo helps. i've been suffering with a tight chest this week not feeling great and also feel my insides inflamed. hope everyone's feeling better than me !!",
          "hi lulu yes i'm ok i went back to work today not as bad as i thought it would be i reckon the walks in the park helped me with the fatigue i'm suffering with being on the phone light etc headaches but i'm still taking l-theanine omeprazole and my daughter got some kalms for me i remember back when i had something on the bridge of my nose now i get a lot of tension there and in my neck you still necking the prosecco good girl gary",
          "hi steph i feel like very tired now but was ok earlier not got a busy one tomorrow so i will battle on looks like you will have to as well you will get there hope it eases tonight gary",
          "that is such good news she told you that dawn - i don't think she would have said anything if she wasn't pretty certain it was ok.i will check out this out but as you say there a lot more articles about the long haulers which it seems we have now been labelled! main thing it is getting recognised and people will hear about this now in mainstream media and maybe understand how tough this has been and offer more support.lx",
          "wow wasn't expecting that gary thought you were off for a good while longer?? hope you didn't feel pressurised into going back too soon - easy for doctor to say get on with life but depends how you feel - i get that it is not good to have too much time on your hands to sit worrying about it all but equally there has to be a balance. see how it goes and only you know how you feel but listen to what your body is telling you - don't doubt yourself, i have done this so many times even at the beginning i had a feeling i had c19 as felt so rough and \"everyone' told me \"it's just a sore throat\" or \"it's just a cold\" - so i pushed through it, kept going, didn't want to be a wimp and i believe that is why i became so unwell - no one knows you better than yourself so please listen and don't underestimate how you feel.take care, don't overdo it.lx",
          "sorry to hear that steph and glad work is ok. i'm with you ..not had a great week either, throat feels very inflamed and chest not great either. very disappointing, hope things improve for us again soon!lx",

          "hi lulu,yes thought the same,feel less anxious about it now.it's good news that it's getting out there at least those behind us will hopefully get more help than we did.there was some good links to it .have a nice day...pressco tues....get your brolly out \ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udd42\u2614x",

          "how is everyone today? i've felt so rough this week and such a shame as hoped we'd get some sun and the sea air would help. have really struggled just feel so unwell almost like the start of a bad cold - throat sore, nose dried out, chesty, tinnitus - am going to have to see someone on my return this is just not right after all this time but who do i see?! gp waste of time just feel there is nowhere to turn feel worse now than a few weeks ago. hope everyone else is doing better than me. maybe it was too early to come away sounds silly but there is a certain amount of stress going on holiday and maybe have done too much - who knows just fed up trying to work it all out! just want to feel well again like i'm sure everyone does.l x",
          "hi luluare you still away? sorry you're not well still. i think it's like any time we're ill, we think we're better until we start doing different things,then we realise we're not recovered yet. i'm doing a lot of normal stuff at home and walking in the garden, but anything different sets me back. i walked to the park the other day and it gave me a bad headache. what's that all about? walking in the garden doesn't! oh well, i'll keep trying.maybe see how you feel with normal routine, hopefully you'll feel better.jo x",
          "thanks jo, i know it is mad isn't it - just seem super sensitive to everything! how are you feeling generally, what are your symptoms other than the headaches now? have just met friends for a couple of early drinks and feel much better than i did but maybe it is the alcohol (!!)or just socialising and forgetting about this for an hour or so.i will see how i feel when get home at weekend.lx",
          "that's good, you're feeling better, maybe stick to the socialising and drinking!i'm still a bit phlegmy in throat and chest, and nose blocks on and off, but i think it's my stomach issues stopping me doing things. it's a lot better with the medication but i notice after eating, even an hour or two afterwards, going upstairs and walking raise my hr and i sometimes get indigestion. hoping that will improve. of course i get tired, but not as much.hope you enjoy the rest of your holidayjo x",
          "hi lulu, jo and everyone, sorry to hear your holiday hasn't given the respite you hoped for lulu. like jo says, it's easy to forget your body is still getting over the trauma of the virus especially when you're feeling good and expecting things to continue to feel good, that's all we've ever known about illness...you start to get better until you are with no setbacks!the weather may be something to do with it also, my naturopath doc told me that weather changes will affect how you feel and my sis has said she notices i'm usually weaker when the weather isn't good.jo i sometimes get a headache after a walk round the block nowadays and sometimes also feel dizzy. past few days have been okayish for me. monday was pretty good, went to my sis (same sis i keep talking about as she is the only one we hang out with!) for a bbq and i had a few hours of feeling almost back to normal.last couple of days have felt back pain and am finding it hard to take a deep breath in but otherwise okayish.have been eating lots of chicken soup and have to say it really perks me up for a couple of hours. i make 2 batches a week of really hearty stuff, lots of veg and it's so good. 3 of my children break up for summer holidays on friday so that's going to change my day...can't say i'll miss all the zoom lessons and convincing them to do their work!",
          "sounds like you are getting on well jo - i've never really had stomach issues but that must be so miserable for you. my problems mainly respiratory tract - my throat and nose feel so dry and inflamed - it got better for a while but worse again now. i think my hr still a bit high too and the tiredness i am same as you is better than it was but still feel wiped out but only good thing is i tend to sleep well now! hope things improve soon for us all.take care,lx",
          "hi daneyes i've never been ill before other than the odd cold so maybe just under estimating how long this will take but i just been getting so low thinking why isn't whatever happened to my body healing now after all this time - i don't understand it. i think you are right about the weather i feel so much better when the sun has been shining - i think the damp weather just accentuates the situation of being unwell and must affect respiratory system - just so worried it is permanent. i seem to alternate between the breathing and the sore throat - if one is good the other isn't and vice versa. is your back pain still in upper back - lung area?the chicken soup sounds good i should def try that its a good way of getting the veg in!hopefully you can lie in a bit in the holidays and not have to rush around getting children to school in morning and get back on your feet - it is good you have your sister around. i have no female support in that no sister, mum, daughter - i think all the men in my life are fed up and don't listen any more! i am lucky though i have a few very close friends who are supporting me but think finding it hard, like the rest of us, to understand what is going on.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone it's been a struggle for me work even though i have not had to do a lot my mates helping me out with most things and they have let me go in on days the tingling is still with me and i have the migraines come and go really dry mouth gotta drink a lot of water hope the dehydration doesn't come back i've tried really hard to stay calm feel the earaches as well try and enjoy your day gary",
          "morning lulu, gary and all,don't worry lulu you will get over it, but i think we all need to lower our expectations of ourselves and just bear in mind the healing is slow. for now it's important to eat well, rest well and do gentle exercise to aid recovery.yes the chicken soup is an excellent way to get the veg in.back pain is upper back but must be muscular as it eases on rest.early this morning was woken by pain in my calf, walked around a bit to settle it down and went back to sleep. joy.lulu no one who isn't going through this is really going to understand what you are dealing with but i'm sure your friends care about you and that's a support just knowing that.gary so sorry your having a hard time. i really hope your headaches and tingling and everything else calms down. wishing everyone a better day than yesterday!",
          "morning gary,hope you feel better soon.may be you need a few more weeks of work pal?jim.",
          "thanks dane, think you are right just need to lower expectations and thanks for the reassurance, it helps so much.i think also have to accept before this had good days and bad days without any explanation - just the way life goes! so easy to blame everything on this!hope the pain in calf is ok, wonder if that is related? who knows! am constantly aware of every ache and pain as am sure everyone is.have a good day, enjoy the chicken and vegetable soup i am going to make this when i get home!lx",
          "hi jim/garyhope you are both ok and making progress and jim the mucus is lessening - mine definitely is but then my throat and chest feels so dry - maybe the mucus keeps it lubricated!gary glad your mates are helping you out but don't overdo it - i know easier said than done but early nights, rest at weekend, eat well and let us know how you are getting on. it must be tough being back in every day but maybe it has helped with the anxiety and having more company.lx",
          "morning lulu,massive dip today.hardly slept, feeling sick, tired, lethargic and cold(36.6c temperature). just generally feel err.fed up to the back teeth of this.happy week 14.oh had my fourth covid test yesterday at the hospital, arranged by work.so results today or tomorrow.hope everyone is having a good day.jim.",
          "sorry to hear that jim i will second that also fed up to back teeth of this - just never know what the day will bring i find even if it starts off ok doesn't mean it will end well and vice versa - never known things to change so fast think that is what causes the anxiety as you are constantly monitoring how you feel and on high alert.was that the antigen test to see if you have it or the antibody one? what was the result of the other 3? surely you would expect to test negative by now?lx",
          "lulu,it was the swab test to see if you've the virus.i've had three before all negative.however, each time i make or given an appointment with medical people they understandably ask if, when and the result of tests etcseeing as i can request further tests through work i plan ahead.i took this one for my upcoming specialist appointments, as i'm following your lead to have a ct scan asap.currently my pf 640(just before lunch) and my spirometer test showed a lung capacity of 5.29 litres.it's a bad day today lulu.jim.",
          "ah ok so you you can say you recently had a negative test and reassure specialist you are not infectious, that makes sense.i think the ct scan will hopefully reassure you jim which will make you feel much better i am now seriously thinking of seeing an ent specialist privately as so much trouble with throat this last week - just keep delaying as hoping it will just gradually get better on its own again as it did a few weeks ago but no idea why it is bad again now. i thought pf640 was pretty good - i haven't done these tests so don't know but thought over 600 was good.i had a day like that yesterday jim i felt so rough so i truly sympathise and really hope you feel better tomorrow.lx",
          "lulu,i wouldn't wait any longer, make an appointment and see a specialist they may put a different slant on it.the average peak flow for a male my age and height should be 600ish as the increments are in two year sections, so above that is down to original fitness etc.i've definitely got anxiety and depression from the whole debacle, which i discussed with the doctor. she thinks an antidepressant would help.i think i'm feeling like this due to my longer walk, hospital visit and half an hour talking to my neighbours when i got home, compounded by the 98 days of semi perpetual illness drags you down.jim.",
          "hi everyonesorry you're feeling so rough jim, hope you have a good rest and feel better tomorrow. it's all we can do on rough daysyour soup does sound delicious, dane, my sister brought me some lovely veg soup a few weeks ago. i didn't have the energy to make any so i lived on tinned chicken soup for a while but it's not as good as home made. i'm tempted to make some now!my throats really dry too,lulu, i even have to have gravy on my chips as i find them quite dryyes, it's all about pacing ourselves and trying not to do too much. i read somewhere about imagining you start each day with several bags of sugar, and if you use them up too soon, there's nothing left for the rest of the day. i think that's so true,and i'm trying to stop myself from doing thattake it easy gary, it must be good to be back at work, must be hard though, working every daykeep positive everyone, we'll get there :)",
          "@dane15 this kind of reminded me of your comment above, about antibodies preventing a reinfection. yesterday my aunt was diagnosed for the 2nd time, , after being totally cleared from a positive test back in early march. its case by case they are figuring out now, hence the antibody tests seperate from the actually infection test. what an utter bummer. i guess the lesson here is make the healthiest possible choices to fight this off and build those beautiful antibodies as much as your body will allow! just how exactly do we do that though... lol. oy vey :rach",
          "hi everyone, sounds like we're all feeling a bit like the weather atm s**t . i feel totally floored everything is such an effort !! who would've thought when we 1st got ill months ago we'd still all be suffering. it's a hell of a virus just can't seem to shake it.jim i'm sure your 4th test will be negative and good luck with the specialist, you're doing the right thing . dane i think you mentioned about the weather having a negative impact on our recovery , i think that's true. bring back the sunshine !! lulu, hope you managed to enjoy your time away despite this \"little sugar\" making you feel down.",
          "thanks steph.i can't remember a day as bad in quite a while.hope you feel better soon.oh happy week 14(98days)jim.",

          "jim as expected? so these awful recurring symptoms are the aftermath rather than the virus itself - at least that is one thing we know for sure! hoping you have a better day tomorrow.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone i'm awake early again not walking because conserving my energy for work it's been a week since i went back to a and e since i felt awful now i feel like i'm getting somewhere i've calmed right down had to do things differently took omeprazole from a and e l-theanine and hemp oil if my migraines got bad took ibuprofen i really didn't realise how bad i got with the anxiety and stress because i never suffered from it before i actually think my gp got something right not going to tell him though go back to work helped me during the day stress came back at night but i started to listen to calming music off utube got a long way to go but i feel a lot better than last week i'm not certain what helped me the most hope you all feel better today gary",

          "guys,i contacted the post covid hub org this morning via whatsapp, as they open at 9.there has been alot of change since it's inception and our first viewing of the site,i was whatsapp'd a few links, which are well worth looking at.hope everyone is having s good day.jim.",
          "glad things are better for you gary probably being at work has been a good distraction. i have not had a good week we are home now and i wonder if it was just too much too soon. didn't think overdid it but looking back probably did a lot more than i have been doing. today i have the thick mucus back and whole respiratory tract just feels awful - feeling very fed up with it all but not sure what to do other than just hope it improves! still contemplating making an appointment with ent specialist but again not really sure what he can do.lx",
          "hi lulu it's not all been plain sailing better than before but i'm still getting migraines and earache and tingling time hopefully will get better forgot to ask before have you tried guaifenesin for the mucus had some but not as much as i thought so looked it up you just gotta keep at it lulu and hopefully it does one soon no work the weekend so i will have to try and stick at it gary",
          "hi luluit's so easy to overdo it, i think i did too much yesterday and i'm really tired today and like you, full of mucus. i didn't do anything too energetic, i just kept busy all day, doing a bit more walking. after so many weeks of it, we just want to be back to normal. it would be useful to get advice from a specialist, but maybe they'll tell you what you already know. hope you feel better after a few days back to normalgary are you finding l-theanine helps you? i'm finding it quite calming",
          "it's better but not as good as i would like it to be lulu it's so wrong that we can't even get over the line and finish with this sorry your week away didn't go well i'm off the weekend but the tension will keep me busy try and have a good weekend lulu still not feeling much like drinking yet myself gary",
          "thanks jo, i think that is the thing being away i didn't want to stop my partner having a good time so tried to keep up - it wasn't that we did a lot just walks, meeting friends, going for dinner but was a lot more than normal i suppose - sounds like you've been overdoing it a bit with the same result! i have decided to see an ent specialist have got the number of one who will see me face to face but just hoping mention of the c-19 doesn't put him off - will ring monday to make appointment. i am fed up second guessing what is going on - i wonder if there will be any c-19 specialists coming through - feel need to speak to someone who actually has some idea about this illness.hope you feel better tomorrow, we need a day of rest by sound of things!lx",
          "hi joanne yes i have found the l-theanine helps i've got so much tension in the head neck shoulder tingling has eased up a little wish it would do one though have a good weekend gary",

          "lulu,i very much doubt any of them have a clue about the virus and subsequent illness. however, the knock on symptoms and add on afflictions they will be able to diagnose and may be treat.i consider the vast majority of the focus is, has been and will remain to stop the virus and create a vaccine.once they do that they might get round to us.jim.",
          "morning,hope everyone is well today.the sun is shining here in god's county, which is a blessing these days.jim.",

          "morning gary, jim, everyonewell done on the week at work gary that must have been a huge challenge physically and mentally! hope you have managed to rest over the weekend and think you said only 3 days next week? jim hope things are slowly improving (think slowly is this operative word in this complete nightmare!) when will the mucus stop? will it ever stop? has yours improved at all do you think?i am up and down feeling a bit low today just wonder if things will ever fully resolve it has just dragged on too long now. i am still chesty and mucusy (mainly in morning) and sore throat still hanging around in the wings and never know when that is going to crop up and just a general feeling of fatigue and not feeling well. i am missing my old life and freedom to go out and about without the stress of all this and not knowing if we can get re-infected. i spose i feel, like all of us on here, very vulnerable especially when we have been so ill and not in great health anyway at the moment. my health and fitness was pretty much everything for me i worked so hard at it and now feel like semi invalid. hard to plan anything as don't know how am going to feel. am missing my boys and my mum (yep i feel sad \ud83d\ude22). anyway once again will pick myself up, dust myself down, remind myself things could be much worse and be thankful for what i have which is a lot.sorry not to have cheered anyone up this morning!! i know how hard it has been for everyone on here and without your support it would have been so much worse and so lonely. better days must be ahead for us all, that is what i keep telling myself!lx",
          "morning lulu,i am so sorry to hear your down. being fair i am very much in the same frame of mind.mucus, lump in the throat, feeling washed out without doing nothing at all none of which have improved in my eyes.had a bad few days this is sh\"t.gary,thanks for the tips.",
          "morning lulu yes it is a pain not being normal i am a lot better than last week but i have still got a way to go yet next three days will be a test working with another gang soy more questions etc which i will be fine with you have been through the wars just lately let's hope next week is really good for us all gary",
          "sounds like you have really got on top of the anxiety gary and maybe being with your mates at work has done you good - i think i'm finding the lack of routine quite hard now too - i was used to working in london two days a week and i miss it and all my friends but equally am too scared to go back into office yet.fingers crossed things pick up and pretty sure you will be fine next week just pace yourself, early nights, eat well and let your work mates help you!lx",
          "it is sh&t jim and the constant mucus is so depressing - it is anti social and i think the mucus is what is making my throat sore. i think it is not knowing how each day is going to pan out is so unsettling - when we were away last week i really struggled as felt so rubbish.anyway jim feeling sorry for ourselves is not going to help us we need to stay positive (i know easier said than done)! i've just done a good walk and have to say getting out in the air really helps lift the mood and it also helps the mucus shift but no doubt there is more from where that came from!take care,lx",
          "i'm trying really hard to stay on top of it lulu not entirely sure how long it will take to get there i still have to rest up early and fight hard during the day it does help having friends at work but they are not aware of what i'm going through to keep it together and how relieved i am to make the weekend you go back when you feel comfortable lulu try and have a good week gary",
          "no that is the problem no-one understands how hard its been.how is your sore throat these days gary as know you suffered badly with this? mine been particularly bad this last week or so that is why i am going to book to see specialist - throat is a mess when i look down it.lx",
          "hi lulu mine is like its dry all the time and a constant battle to keep an eye on it i've had like a pressure on my neck and shoulder but they maybe linked to the anxiety because i still have migraines i'm not sure it certainly should have gone ages ago gary",
          "hi gary and everyone,i've done it again.felt ok so took my youngest to a birthday party, half hour drive and 2.5 hours walking around at the party. had to leave early as started feeling a little odd in my legs and a bit breathless. got home exhausted. body temp up to 37.5 and it was 36.9 before i left home, nose feels stuffy and feeling a bit jittery.why do i never learn???i hope i'm able to bounce back quick from this. shame i really felt i was getting somewhere these past few days.gary and lulu, people don't get what we're feeling because we look ok and sound ok even while we're telling them we're not ok and especially because some days we might actually be ok, so how does that work?hope you get somewhere with a specialist lulu and gary keep updating us about what's helping you. i'm sure we've all got some form of anxiety after what we've been through.",
          "hi everyone sounds like your all still struggling with symptoms. i've been back at work 2 weeks now got over the mask thing now and i'm ok,i'm off for 12 days now so going to chill . my eyes have been really dry the last few days got eye drop and beconase see if that helps sure its that mask it moves up to my eyes and rubs the eye lids. saw the grandkids yesterday and mum came up and sat in our garden today and chatted about the olds days with my neighbour which done her good. we're all doing really well considering how we were a few months back it's going to take along time to get over this. chin up everyone we're all tough \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",
          "*hi dane it's true they don't see the pain we are going to have to try to work out what to do and how much for a while yet i was lucky that i took a step back a little while ago and looked at the medication i was taking i never realised how bad my anxiety was and the stress of it its been over a week since i went back to a and e i am improving but slowly same as all of us really bloody nightmare gary *",
          "ps i'm still tired in evenings and normally in bed by 8 or 9",
          "hi susan well done your getting right back on track your right gotta keep positive and this nightmare will hopefully do one enjoy your time off looks like the weather is going to be good for you as well gary",
          "it must be so hard dane not to overdo it when you are feeling ok - life carries on with small children and must be so hard to rest! i'm sure you will bounce back - i think a couple of days of taking it easy will do the trick - i think we are just surprised when the relapses still keep coming. i was telling someone today about how ill i'd been and i had the \"were you tested\" \"so it could have been something else\" conversation!really hope you feel better tomorrow, try and get an early night! lx",
          "hi susansounds like you are doing really well, have all the other symptoms gone now?lovely you had some quality time with the grandchildren and your mum - it makes such a difference especially when the weather is so good.enjoy your days off work, hopefully sitting in the garden and walking on beach!lx",
          "that's sensible, i stay up far too late - i might need to do the same and go to bed early. i have stopped drinking alcohol to see if that helps so no more prosecco tuesdays on the green for me \ud83d\ude12 or wine with dinner - only going to do it for a week to see if any difference! lx",
          "hi lulu i still get fatigue and some days i get that pain up top of shoulder blades but my lungs and breathing are ok now. just can't rush around like i use to on days off was always out and about, but think that's more due to the situation we're in as don't want to be around lots of people. it's good to have a day meeting a friend and having a procesco awful drink lol im a cider drinker not drunk since being ill but on tablets might have a glass of rose over the week see how i feel. i'm going for 9 1/2 again this week.",
          "hi lulu and everyone, i've been away for a few days by the sea tying in with family stuff hoping it would do me good. it was a struggle trying to keep up and like someone mentioned in previous posts, we look ok so they don't know what we're going through !! at one point on saturday i just wanted to come back home. i agree with you about feeling semi invalid lulu. this virus has taken away lots of things which in normal circumstances we'd take for granted. i hope things get better for all of us soon. xx",
          "hi everyonewe're all still battling on, it has to be in the final stagessorry about trips away, lulu and steph, it's stopping us from doing so many things. if recovering from other illnesses you would probably feel better after a few days away, but not this onei'm staying on 8 this week, i think i'll be there for a while. it seems to be in my head at the moment, sore throat, maybe glands, lots of phlegm of course. like your theory, lulu, moving up, hoping it's going to pop out!hope work goes ok for everyone working this week, and hope everyone else ok :)",
          "hi guys, just spent an hour speaking with a respiratory nurse via the post covid hub.really nice person who went through everything from checking all symptoms, chronological regurgitation of the history of my illness. went through intervention with hospitals and surgeries.finished with advice in what to ask doctors, specialists etc.i would recommend everyone to csll or whatsapp them.jim.",
          "hi jo and everyonei think i am back to a 9 this week!! i am going backwards over last couple of weeks, sorry to hear you are still suffering, mine is exactly same seems to all be in the head in fact feels like my head is about to explode and the throat is sore and nice bit of mucus to add to the delight of all this!have booked to see an ent specialist on weds morning so hopefully will get some more answers which may help all of us suffering with the throat and mucus issues. i am seeing him face to face - first person to have looked at me in 4 months!will keep you postedtake carelx",
          "thanks jim sounds like she gave you plenty of time - anything significant you can share - like are we going to recover any time soon?!!lx",
          "susuan, so good your breathing and lungs are ok now and a good score hopefully not far to go until you feel fully recovered. am sure the fatigue will get better in time. i think this has really slowed us all down and feel the same don't like being with a lot of people. too many people showing no respect or social distancing.i definitely think you deserve a cider or two on your days off - i never think to drink cider but now you have sewn the seed i might give it a try after my week of abstinence!take care,lx",
          "i felt same too steph i really wanted to come home at one point it was just too much for me (sounds a bit pathetic). i can do most things now but not all on the same day!! my stamina is non-existent.hopefully things will gradually improve and we probably shouldn't rush it - am going to take it easier this week.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu, everyone its 17 weeks for me today. would have gone for a 9 before yesterday but very breathless today and exhausted since going to the party so going to not score myself in the hope this is a small blip in recovery.so glad for you that you have a face to face appt lulu, it's about time!my sis wants us to go away with her up north this week for a break, from what i've heard from you and steph think it's a no. anyway, i'm breathless can't imagine going anywhere now.feeling really frustrated as we all are.",
          "lulu,she suggested looking at each symptom individually and trying to abate one at a time due to the possible crossovers within the respiratory system ent and lungs etc.even though i've a higher than normal pf and my spirometer results were okay she picked up on the differences i sometimes have in pf. if there is a difference of 15% it sets bells ringing. also there is a percentage on spirometry tests mine being 79.9% which is very close to the lowest normal level of 80% however she said age, fitness level etc i should be near 100%.she said spiro tests need to be done over time to see variances also pf needs to be tracked over 3 weeks but with possible use of blue inhalers via a spacer to see if there is an improvement.she also explained how to use nasal sprays and advised on a prescription only spray.we discussed an and to it all. its all dependent on whether its copd(worse case) bronchiectasis, asthma or inflammation, which is asthma but there's a difference. she explained but i've forgotten.we spoke about ct scans and she explained they show alot copd, scaring but not necessarily mild or medium asthma.no timelines unfortunately.she did say there are alot of people in the same boat.jim.",
          "so quite a detailed and in depth conversation - did she mention anything about the mucus? i will obviously ask my guy about this weds.lx",
          "wow 17 weeks, i'll have to check with my covid buddy gary to find out where we are but must be about 14 weeks i reckon for us! would be great to get away with your sister but i think it is more stressful than it sounds just getting packed up and then the pressure to do more stuff than usual.really hope it is a quick blip and you pick up again soon, it is so frustrating and depressing it has just been too long to be unwell.lx",
          "lulu,she said mucus is a result of inflammation, which \"might\" go.inflammation can be the result of numerous illnesses not all of which can be picked up by xrays ct scans spirometer, blood tests etc but as a whole investigation.it left me bewildered to be honest.the cut and thrust from what i can understand is we need all these tests for a proper diagnosis.jim.",
          "think you guys are a week or 2 behind me if i'm not mistaken.it's been so long. will speak to my gp tomorrow to check if she's referred me on for any tests. been nearly 2 weeks since last trip to a and e and they said i should get an echo done.feel like the only way forward is to go private but no idea what the costs will amount to once you go down that route.will save the vacation for another time.jim, good for you that you managed to get useful advice, we all need that but mostly aren't getting it.",
          "lulu,steph and i are week 14, 15 on thursday. you gary and stuart are 16 or 17 i think.",
          "dane,ring them. well worth it.",
          "hi guys and girls yes i have a feeling we are week 16 and i feel terrible today dry mouth and migraines still heavy hands tingling comes and goes same as anxiety drained but will rest up tonight and crack on tomorrow lads help me but i can see to some of them i don't look ill but i understand that and push on lulu let me know how you get on with the specialist i can still feel my throat is sore not as bad but not right i am in the middle of changing gps so hopefully it will be sorted out and i can get to talk to someone soon gary",
          "sorry if i've put you off going away dane but i just didn't feel ready enough to be away from my home comforts when i didn't feel great. think the anxiety didn't help either. i feel a shadow of my former self !! these days all i want to do is lounge around haven't got the energy for anything else. got the inner shakes again so feels like it's one step forward and 3 steps back . breathing is noisy too.",
          "yep think we are week 16 gary - what a long haul this is. sorry you've not felt good today it must be so bloody hard trying to work and feeling so cr&p. i feel like i've got a head cold today and dry mouth and sore throat - every day is different it's just unbelievable. hope the new gp helps you more than the previous one. i started crying on phone this morning to mine (poor bloke) said had been ill for 4 months, no support, not seen anyone, just feel so unwell - he did listen and made all the right noises but bottom line is they just don't know enough and he said as jim mentioned i think you have to tackle each symptom individually so that is why he has referred me now to ent specialist and said speak to respiratory consultant again before september if not improving. i know that is what you've been trying to do too gary sort out each symptom. btw is anyone still coughing regularly?lx",
          "not all steph! relieved you reported back how it went. now i can say i know 2 people who went away and it wasn't good for them. everyone keeps saying a change of scenery will do me good but at the back of my mind i know it's too early for me. i also need my comforts and it's right here at home.sorry you're not feeling good again. it really gets you down when you think you're finally making real progress and then there's a setback. i'm struggling today as well.i just hope these setbacks are milder and shorter lasting than before that's the thought that keeps me going.",
          "that should read...'not at all' :)",
          "yep week 16 for us - not feeling too optimistic about the magic week 18. when did res and stuart start feeling better anyone remember? think they are a lot younger than me so that must have helped too. lx",
          "jimsurely she was not suggesting it was anything other than covid? what else could it be with same symptoms and would go on for this long? - that's just too much of a coincidence. it may be that you are left presenting similar symptoms to copd and asthma but doesn't mean you have those ongoing illnesses - my doctor tried to tell me i had copd if you remember. i think the inflammation will get better and i know mine has as at one point i could hardly inhale as so painful and the mucus will slowly go and again mine has improved loads (see i'm being positive now jim!) i think we need to see what the ent specialist has to say weds - any ent questions anyone has other than the obvious ones we've talked about let me know and i'll ask them.lx",
          "evening lulu i can understand that you had a good cry blimey we all have we wouldn't be human beings if we didn't and 16 weeks of not getting back to normal isn't right but someone did say 18 weeks we should be ok so in two weeks time we will be back to normal i know about tackling each symptom we have but they keep coming back or won't go gary",
          "i think stuart is still like us lulu.",
          "what she meant was that we have been left with either copd, bronch?whatever and/or asthma from the virus.definitely agree with you about you seeing the specialist etc because he will know loads more.",
          "ok understand now, yep let's see what he thinks and if things don't improve i am also going to speak to the respiratory guy again (might even be able to see him face to face now) am not going to wait until september. lx",
          "that was my cousins boyfriend who was ill on isle of bute - was never tested but had all the symptoms and reckons it took him 18 weeks - we are running out of time!fingers crossed we all pick up again, i do remember res i think having a bad relapse around 17 weeks and then posting that he had picked up again so who knows?!lx",
          "i've only gone and got a trapped nerve in my right shin as well now that is definitely not one of the symptoms it is driving me nuts oh well another thing to add to the doctors list when i get confirmation i have a new gp hope you all have a good evening 18 weeks flu like symptoms always makes me laugh gary",
          "sensible.the respiratory nurse questioned when i had my spirometer test. i told her 25/6/20 to which she replied they had been told not to do them since the outbreak due to the high possibility of infection. thats why we haven't been seen when referred because these are the tests they need to do to diagnose our conditions.",
          "yes that was why i went private and had ct scan if you remember because after my chest xray doctor recommended lung function test then when i tried to book it was told they were not carrying out as face to face so i have still never had one done. lx",
          "its truly ridiculous the way we've been treated.the specialist may suggest them this time round.",
          "oh no poor you, bet you need that like a hole in the head on top of everything else. yep mild flu like symptoms - if only \ud83d\ude44 scary thing is people still believe this.just taken some flarin it does really help are you still taking it regularly?lx",
          "hi lulu no i've stopped taking flarin i've been working on the anxiety and tingling and migraines it would probably help the migraines i'm taking l-theanine which helps and hemp oil calms me the tingling has eased and the migraines but i think i've got this for a while yet if the migraines persist i've got flarin bloody one thing after another as we all know gary",
          "ah ok at least you know it helps if you need it for the migraines. can always take it as a one off for a bit of relief.take care,lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone that is the trouble i have the intensity of the headaches and earaches at nights are still here they ease in the morning dry nights haven't gone i could use the flarin to ease it i'm still hoping this new gps will be able to help gary",
          "morning gary and everyone,sorry about your headache and earache must be so disturbing for your sleep.i hope you get a decent new gp that could be a life changer.i just spoke to mine, and she was actually very helpful. she said this has gone on too long and she's going to chase some specialists to try and move things. she said she's been thinking a lot about me and is upset that she has not received any guidance and no protocols in place to deal with patients in our situation. she's booked me in for another call this afternoon so she can tell me what she's heard from the specialists. finally gp being proactive, cried at the end of the call it's been so long and really needed that fighting support.",
          "hi daneso glad she was helpful and was supportive - i cried to mine too yesterday perhaps that's what it takes to make the gps realise we are really struggling with this on our own and have been for months. my partner listened to sky news last night where they highlighted the ongoing symptoms and worry about future health issues and how awful it is and he was very sympathetic after - maybe people are realising at last we need some tlc and support, encouragement, kind words and this is not just a case of mild flu for many people.let us know what she comes back with this afternoon.take care and hope you have a good day.lx",
          "hi dane that's great news for you and hopefully i will get the wheels in motion soon and get out of this bloody nightmare gary",
          "hope you have a better day today gary, thinking of you and everyone suffering all these symptoms and hope it's a better day than the last few have been. let your work mates take the strain, if you haven't already maybe confide in one or two about how crap you really are feeling and it will get passed on. i hope they look after you.take care,lx",
          "hi jimhow are you today? just wanted to mention i've gone back to the fresh squeezed orange juice and lemon juice (1 of each) in the morning haven't been doing this for a couple of weeks and it seems to help with cutting through the mucus. original doctor who diagnosed c19 back in march told me to do this daily (in fact she said just pure lemon juice).it might be worth a try and good for the vitamin intake.all the best,lx",
          "i cried from sheer relief, gp had no idea the tears were falling, think there's a lot of pent up emotion after trying to stay strong and positive for all this time. good your partner saw stuff on the news, def need lots of tlc we all do!",
          "afternoon lulu,thank you for the tip.hooe your well?feel tired today and lots of mucus, so no change really.jim.",
          "hi everyonelulu, good luck with your appointment tomorrow, that's great you get to see them face-to-face. hope you get some answers, it's gone on for so long. i'd like to know where the mucus comes from, throat, chest, stomach? is there any way of telling? my doctor was a bit vague when i asked him. my stomach got a bit sore yesterday when i was de-phlegming, so i'm being careful today.i'm feeling quite pleased today, i managed to walk to the local shops for the first time for a while. i'd been gradually building up on my walking in order to do so.gary, i'm with you regarding anxiety, i got really worked up about going out, i took a few drops of hemp oil to calm me. seems daft that something i used to do most days, should get me that worked up. dane, that's great that you are now getting support from your gp, hope it's helpful for youjim, hope your day improvesall the best everyone :)",
          "well done to you joanne, that's the way to do it, slow and steady. some of us are learning that the hard way.gp has rung back. she's calling the respiratory services at barnet to get me in with a specialist there, they were closed for the day by the time she tried so it will have to be tomorrow. she's hoping it will be a one stop shop if i get in there with help all round for lungs, heart etc.",
          "what fantastic news!i'm so pleased for you.",
          "brilliant news dane sounds exactly what you need and you will get some the answers you need.lx",
          "thanks dane, yes i learnt hard way too! i had to start all over again with walking several weeks ago when i had a setback/relapse probably due to overdoing it. i must be more careful....that's great news for you, sounds like they're going to support you with everything",
          "hi joreally good progress walking to the local shops - i know it is stressful going out and about but it is so good getting back to some sort of normality isn't it - i am happy about the face mask situation as makes me feel so much safer. i did go to a couple of restaurants last week but won't do it again would only be happy sitting outside.i will definitely be asking about the mucus and will let you know tomorrow.hope you've enjoyed your day.lx",
          "thanks lulu, jim, johope it works out at barnet and don't have to wait a year to be seen. been doing better today than yesterday which is a relief still going to take it easy.i'm very pleased about the mask rule too, so obviously needed.",
          "have been feeling much better today jim - felt truly awful yesterday as if i had a head cold and head was going to explode - completely gone today - why??!! i just do not understand what is going on! will i get it back tomorrow.. who knows? my throat has been better too today but is just getting sore now so will take some flarin maybe that is helping with the inflammation - i took it last night too. hope you have picked up this afternoon. will let you know what he says about mucus tomorrow after appointment, hoping it will be reassuring.lx",
          "thats very kind of you lulu.hope you feel better and stay better.hope the specialist answers all our questions!jim.",
          "evening. i was just curious if you could expand on your sore throat feeling?is the pain coming from the top soft palette area? and is it affecting your ears? also what is the stuff you use to help inflammation? thanks",
          "thanks luluthat's strange, my head cold/sore throat are a lot better today. we never know what's going to happen nexti'm pleased about the mask rule too, there were only a few of us wearing them today, and it will be a lot safer when everyone's wearing them. hope you're surviving ok without wine and prosecco. i'm still struggling to have a whole glass of wine, it sends me to sleep! i'll keep trying",
          "hi tarathe roof of my mouth does feel sore almost as if i have thrush. it is not too bad in the morning but gets worse by the evening - it hurts to swallow and the pain is mainly at the sides of my throat - i can see it is very red and inflamed on both sides and has a white coating. i have tinnitus in my ears which also gets worse by the evening. my tongue also doesn't feel quite right sort of tingly. when i inhale deeply i can feel it in my windpipe a bit like you are inhaling ice cold air on a winter's day.hope this helps.lx",
          "so weird isn't it jo. i try and analyse everything i've done differently and no idea why it comes and goes. i did take flarin last night as it was so bad so wonder if that has helped with the inflammation. yes roll on 24th july!i only started drinking small glass of wine every night when i got ill funnily enough - just needed something to calm me down and it did help! am meeting friends thursday and am sure there will be a glass of prosecco involved!sorry tara meant to say it is flarin taking for inflammation it is a lipid ibruprofen can get from boots or superdrug - apparently better for stomach than regular ibruprofen - only downside is they are size of horse tablets!lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone, just wanted to wish you luck with specialist tomorrow lulu. my question would be how long does this congestion last e.g chest, mucus, ears, throat and head it all feels inflamed and congested. my ears have been blocked for months. i'm sure face to face will be much better and hopefully it's a thorough examination. hope you're not too anxious you're doing the best thing. i'll be doing the same if this carries on. xxdane really pleased you're being referred good luck xx",
          "thanks steph, will definitely ask that and update you all tomorrow.hope things are going well.take care,lx",
          "lulu good luck for tomorrow. my husband has got me into the habit of writing everything down i want to discuss with a dr before any appt, sometimes you wait so long to speak to someone and then forget some things you wanted to say when you're in the moment. you may do this already, thought i'll mention if it will help!",
          "yes good idea, will definitely do that. thank you xx",
          "hi jim and everyone. it's been quite a while since i was on here. i was finding it very difficult to post on the site as it kept freezing and lagging and unfortunately my patience ran out (i seem to have very little these days) and i disappeared for a bit. i've had to write this in a notepad document as it's still lagging here. but i have been wanting to write for quite a while. i'd love to say i'm fit and well now but i'm not. i have had a really good period of 8 days with one bad day in the middle, but the rest of the time has been up and down. you know the routine.a positive has been the ability to walk more and for longer to the point i felt almost normal. i even jogged for 30 seconds! \ud83d\ude02 wow! it felt great. i was sure the end was in sight. unfortunately the last few days have been horrible though. difficulty breathing, congested nose and splitting headaches, with body chills. a new pile of symptoms to deal with. i really don't understand what is happening. it feels like i have gone back 16 weeks to my bed ridden days.i tried getting my doc to be interested but nothing came of it. no ct scan as they say they can't authorise one, no spirometry test to see if i have asthma or copd, no suggestions, no care - nothing. i have to admit it made me feel ill with anger at the lack of basic treatment and left me feeling totally helpless. i don't feel very comfortable coming back on here and moaning, i would much prefer to come here and tell you all good news like i was certain i would do a week ago. hopefully tomorrow will be better for all. i wish everyone the recovery you all deserve. ps good luck with your appointment lulu",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've finally managed to get through to a gp who has an idea what she is talking about my migraines have been tension headaches also causing earaches stress around my neck and shoulder all bringing on the anxiety issues and tingling hands because of how long i've been ill dehydration same i've got to go to the surgery in the morning to get my ears checked out by the nurse i will be fine in time she said to get some over the counter medicine to help with the sleeping keep an eye on how it is in a couple of weeks maybe 18 will be the lucky number i'm hoping all of you are doing well gary",
          "hi stuart it has been a long time and i wondered how you were doing obviously same as us up and down like us all it's not right that no one is listening to you it is so hard when you can't get the help you need i have changed my gp and i really think you should as well i know you're the same time frame as me i hope you feel better soon gary",
          "hi gary, thanks for your reply. have you changed your gp surgery or just asked to see a different one at your current surgery?as far as i can tell they are all useless at mine. i did change my address a few months ago and intended to change to the local surgery but then all this happened and i thought it would be a mistake to sign up to a new gp who had never seen me. but now i'm tempted to do it. start fresh.i'm sorry to read about your headaches. i have had one since yesterday that kept me awake all night. i guess it is a migraine but i've never had one before. don't know if it was brought on by stress because of my anger with the lack of care from the medical services, or part of the illness.i'm bed ridden with it \ud83d\ude16 does anything give you relief? i hope you feel better soon gary anyway. what a mess this all is eh? all the best. stuart ps apologies if i don't reply for a while, i'm writing this during a lull in the headache. hard to write when it's full power.",
          "hi stuart i've changed my surgery i was hardly ever ill before the 20th march i've had very little help from my previous surgery so my friend could not believe how bad it was i've been suffering from anxiety and stress tension headaches and earaches tingling hands and legs lack of sleep etc got to see a nurse in the morning who is going to check my ears i've got nytol to try and help me sleep you should change your gp now g",
          "hi stuart & everyonereally sorry to hear this you must be so fed up and low - i'd change surgeries - it makes such a difference who you get and ask for a sympathetic doctor who has dealt with c19 patients.just had face to face with really friendly ent guy who was a really good listener (he had been skiing in march with 8 friends 5 caught it and 3 didnt apparently) - camera up nose and down throat (nice!) quite a bit of mucus in nose and throat and throat inflamed he has said it is laryngitis reflux and has prescribed lanzaprasole (which i think others have been taking?) and gaviscon. i am know sure this is the right diagnosis but he seemed pretty certain and to be fair the respiratory guy said i did not have much mucus in lungs so maybe the mucus is mainly in nose/throat. he asked about the feeling of ball of mucus at the back of throat and said that was quite typical symptom. he knew a lot about covid-19 reckons loads of people fight it off with t cells and don't produce antibodies - said my body had done an amazing job fighting it off (!!) and yep its just time will recover - he said the people they are doubting full recovery are those who have been in icu and intubated. he said stress worsens the reflux issue and also the tinnitus. i asked why it had started exactly when i got c19- he said you probably had reflux mildly before but didn't bother you too much but because of the inflammation now in throat and airways it is more acute. stop eating/drinking fresh lemon/orange (just suggested that to you jim yesterday so stop before you start!!), don't eat late, don't eat tomatoes, spicy food. keep hydrated.anyway sorry there are no ground breaking or earth shattering revelations here but he was very upbeat and am going to see him in a month and good news is he had a good poke around and nothing sinister going on.really wish you luck with finding a good gp stuart and wish you better.lx",
          "hi everyone thanks for the update lulu about the mucas in throat i'm on lansoprazole and it has helped alot. sorry to hear alot of you are still suffering with symptoms. i've been withdrawing from diazepam and now stopped zopiclone the sleeping tab and going back to nytol when needed think this gives me lots of sweats and flu like symptoms. glad your all getting help now i'm ok with breathing now fingers crossed. it's nice to get gp and hospital free time now.",
          "hi susanwhy were you given lansoprazole was that for the sore throat? in what way has it helped and did it take long to kick in? brilliant you are withdrawing from the diazepam that is such good news - i reckon they did their job but you will feel much better now without them and as you say you have nytol as a back up if you need it.lx",
          "i was given it for the meds i am on as i've always suffered with reflux in stomach. i've been having a lemon warm water each morning as well which had helped with the mucas and take beconase which is helping my sinuses etc and the mucas in my throat i still get the odd sore throat and flu like symptoms still but not sure if that withdrawal from the medications? my breathing feels ok now i'm doing lots of walking etc. i just put it out my mind now it helps more otherwise i start getting anxious let's hope a vaccine comes along quickly. also i take 2500 iu vit d3 and a multi vit drink each day.",
          "that's really good news gary makes such a difference if gp is helpful. the guy i have just seen mentioned stress and anxiety a lot with regard to both the reflux and tinnitus and he did say \"it is hardly surprising you have been stressed - we are all stressed and we haven't been ill\" - i think the more medical support and reassurance we get the less stressed we feel and our recovery will be quicker. when i look back to april when i (and most of us on here) were so ill and 1000+ people a day were dying my anxiety levels were literally through the roof. it is easy to underestimate what we have been through as we have been in the midst of a deadly pandemic with no or very little medical support and the anxiety has really taken it's toll on our mental health as well as the physical issues of the virus we have had to deal with.lx",
          "gosh lulu, we've got the same issues then, lump in throat, mucus and reflux. i was on lanzoprazole for 6 days and stopped of my own accord because i wanted to take famotidine instead. i take that every night and it has eased the lump feeling in the throat but it's not gone away completely. i'm also able to eat a bit better now, before i was getting full eating hardly anything and my weight was dropping.interesting he said you probably had mild reflux before and didn't notice it. i wonder if i had that too as had post nasal drip for ages which could be connected. did he give any advice about reducing the inflammation? i also feel my wind pipe is sore sometimes on inhaling i think you said you have that.so good you had a real diagnostic test now you know where you stand.stuart, sorry to hear you're struggling again, that is such a disappointment after feeling good. i have heard that towards the end of recovery relapses become fewer and further between. hopefully you are right at the end of it you just need to keep going!susan, good to hear you're doing well. are you able to eat regular foods while on lanzoprazole or do you still avoid foods that can aggravate the reflux?i'm struggling with fatigue and breathlessness again today, went to bed really late last night because i had a meltdown crying in bed, knew it was a bad idea but couldn't fight back tears. that might be why i could only start my day in the afternoon today. very little energy :( but did manage to make another pot of chicken soup so i guess can't be too bad. guys and girls what can we do to help ourselves with anxiety?",
          "hi lulu i can fully understand now why we have taken so long to even think about being normal after dealing with everything and more the tension headaches have been going on for so long now and obviously everything else that goes with what we all have had to deal with it was only because i took a step back and took a look at what i wtoas taking i realised that i had a problem and it all came on top of me and now i have to deal with what most of us have to i realised that i had to get a new gp and now we can all concentrate on getting back to normal i i forgot to ask do you think because the amount of time it's been our lungs should be fine gary",
          "hi danehe said the inflammation will reduce as the acid reflux is treated - i had a few weeks when sore throat was better but was really bad last couple of weeks - from what i've read it is quite common to have this after a virus or rather have it much worse after a respiratory virus when your airways are already inflamed and the acid just exacerbates it. i am glad he looked up nose and down throat at least nothing bad happening. i think from googling lanzoprazole is considered a bit more effective than famotidine. if you google lpr - it can feel like asthma, lump in throat, can affect breathing etc. so am pretty certain this is what it is now i've researched it better - wasn't sure earlier.dane, i was like that monday was crying felt so low so please don't feel like you are alone - some days able to cope with this and some days can't it all just gets too much. hoping you are getting plenty of support and tlc xlx",
          "hi luluthat's great you've got a proper diagnosis and are being given treatment for it. i think a few of us have similar things, i'm taking omeprazole for the reflux, but mine seems to be more in my stomach. i read about what not to eat, but i don't think citrus fruit and tomatoes make mine worse. not sure really though. it's bending over that seems to affect me, so having to be careful with that.it must be a relief to you having seen him, and it's good you're having a follow-up",
          "it's must've been so hard for you on your own gary - it makes me sad everyone who has been so ill without partners to support them and no wonder you have had the anxiety but it is all getting sorted now and the new gp will help you.i really believe so - it is the healing process which takes a long time - both specialists told me that. lx",
          "hi danesorry you're struggling at the moment, it's such a long haul, but we'll get there i'm finding l-theanine (recommended by maciek) quite calming, and i have hemp oil and rescue remedy as a back-up for anxiety. hopefully as we recover we'll feel less anxious",
          "yeah i know what you mean lulu i tried to keep my kids away from me till i thought i was going to be ok i know i had the chest xrays and everything but i still don't have a clue how long it will take to get ok again my daughter was asking me what to do for my birthday and i'm like oh not a big fuss god i just want this year to go i know i shouldn't but 2020 do one gary",
          "your new surgery sounds really good gary, it's a shame they're not all like that. good luck in fighting those last few symptoms!stuart, sorry you're so unwell, hope this relapse soon goes and you're back to where you are",
          "hi joanne yes i needed a new surgery looks like me and you are using the same medication l-theanine and hemp oil calms me down as well hopefully the nurse will not find anything wrong in the morning got a 7 o'clock appointment early start tomorrow for me hopefully a good night for everyone gary",
          "hi lulu,yes lanzoprazole is the better treatment, i just wanted to try famotidine because of studies that suggest it may help with other covid symptoms. i haven't had a sore throat in a while but do have little lump in throat and get a bit of mucus. i also still tend to feel full after not eating much but not as bad as it was. i'm on quite a strict diet to exclude acidic foods at the same time trying to put on weight, it is some effort! will keep going with famotidine a bit longer to give it a good chance, then i'll see.still feeling a bit down today :( have hardly done anything the whole day because of the breathlessness. waiting for my husband to finish with work so it's not just me moping around next to the kids. guess weather not helping.hope everyone has a good evening.",
          "thanks jo, will look those up.",
          "it is all such a pain - gp told me to drink neat lemon juice for the vit c and would cut through the mucus then this guy told me to avoid citrus fruit!! don't know if you are coming or going! i have put my weight back on now which is good and appetite is normal.i felt exactly same monday was so down my friend i walk with told me today that she was really worried about me, woke up yesterday and today and felt so much better physically and mentally - it will pass just hang in there and take care of yourself - maybe a nice relaxing bath and early night if you can. i am working tomorrow and friday so hopefully will keep my mind off things.take care,lx",
          "tell me about it. i was chucking down fresh garlic because was told it's good for your immune system and drinking lemon and ginger tea and then told to scrap all of that. also was told to eat full fat yogurts to put on weight but high fat foods aren't good for acid stomach....so yeah been round in circles too.great for distractions sake to get out to work but don't forget to take it easy and slow! hope all goes well.will try and get an earlier night tonight.good night all!",
          "i'm just the same, dane, lului don't know what to eat or drink any more. had rough night with the churning when i lay down. been trying to work out what set it off. was it tomatoes or pineapple juice? i've been ok with those so far. or chocolate could have done it. it's really confusing. you're right, what's good for one symptom, is bad for another. we can't win!hope you're feeling better dane and work goes ok luluhope everyone has a good day",
          "hello lulu, it's very nice to hear from you and i really appreciate your words. in fact i'd like to say thanks to everyone who has sent me good wishes - i would prefer to reply individually to you all, but writing on this forum has become tricky as it keeps lagging and freezing on me, so i'll do it all here. anyway, thanks so much to all of you as just a few nice words make such a difference to the soul and to tell the truth they put a little tear in my eye.i'm so happy you had a constructive and positive experience with the specialist lulu, that's great news. how often and when are you taking the lansaprozole, is it first thing in the morning? and what strength is it? i ask because i've been having the lump in the throat and post nasal drip stuff. i also have a box of unused lansaprozole 15mg so maybe i can use them. i think you brought back positive info for everyone! it's great to hear what the specialists have got to say and what their experiences are. we all need that hope of a better future, it helps so much with all this damned stress, frustration and anxiety. well done \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4fon a personal note, my headache has eased to a low buzz, thank goodness and i slept well last night. i will change my gp but the one problem i have is that i was supposed to have a blood test yesterday to re check a high liver enzymes result that i had in a previous test two months ago. i had to cancel it yesterday as i was so ill and need to reschedule - so i think i need to complete that before changing gp to avoid complications. anyway i'll stop rambling, thanks again to yourself and everyone. i hope you all feel better soon and recovery is imminent. all the best stuart",
          "hi stuartglad the headache has eased and you are feeling a bit better today, amazing also what a good night's sleep does. i am taking two 30mg tablets a day one first thing in morning and the other half an hour before food so will take early evening. he also prescribed gaviscon advance liquid two teaspoons 3 times a day after food and 1 last thing at night (you can buy over counter i think). i have to say the mucus already feels so much better. i thought it was coming from lungs which early on i think it was but respiratory guy said he could see some mucus in lungs from ct scan but not a lot so i think last few weeks it has been in throat. any form of laryngitis is common after a viral infection especially a respiratory one so it does all make sense now to me.maybe check with gp and start taking the lansaprazole again - the lump of mucus feel in back of throat is a very common symptom of reflux laryngitis and it can also affect breathing due to the inflammation of all the respiratory tubes. as i said i probably had it very midly before c19 and it didn't bother me - he seemed to think it will clear up pretty quickly with the right treatment.anyway hope this helps and everyone is ok today and feeling more positive. lx",
          "afternoon lulu and everyone l finally got some good news i went to the surgery today and the nurse checked my ears and said one needs to be waxed but shouldn't be causing a bad earache so got olive oil to wax it then gets home just now and gets a call from the covid nurse and she is referring me back to watford general to be looked at again she feels like most of us i have had it and wants to get me checked out again gary",

          "hi dane, you've given the special diet a go and if it's not making a difference just go back to what you were already eating. i know sometimes cutting out certain foods help some medical conditions but no one really knows enough about this \"little sugar\" yet. i've defo upped my vits and supplements but haven't cut out any foods. it's funny with colds and flu you get the stuffy nose then runny nose at end but this had a beginning but no end yet !! just want all the sugar out of my body now !!",
          "well, extreme tiredness, mucus on my chest and nasal blockage.sh?t really.",
          "hi dane i had a conversation with the nurse about the throat and dry mouth and night sweats said that i had a sore throat for so long and dry mouth and that was what i think swung the referral back to the hospital because i remember that when i was first ill the bridge of my nose was where i felt it before my throat the bridge of my nose is where i am also getting tension now it didn't make sense to me but it did to the nurse gary",
          "nothing really seems to make sense. at least you're getting help that's the main thing and hopefully they'll sort you out quick.",
          "yeh steph, no idea if the diet was helping. ate quite healthily before so not exactly going wild on sugary foods now. will try to include more veg but that's it. fed up that's for sure.",
          "hi dane and everyone!my voice is definitely not right my friend says it sounds quite clipped and i can hear it is not right - it is strange about the reflux but laryngitis is really common after a virus and think it is common to have a little reflux and think this is just making it worse - my throat, mucus and the fire in the windpipe (i get the same steph) feels so much better already after two days of lansoprazole and gaviscon- reflux laryngitis can also make you feel like you have asthma - do you remember how we all felt when the weather was so hot and the pollen bad and doctors telling us we were hyper-sensitive or had hayfever - it makes sense the larynx is inflamed after all the coughing and bringing mucus up.really pleased you are getting some help now gary and dane i think you are right about the diet - surely just eat well and try and make things you enjoy and build yourself up.made me laugh steph giving the gp a week off!! when i first got ill in march and contacted gp i had been unregistered as not been for so many years - have made up for it last few months they won't be forgetting me any time soon! lx",
          "glad i made you laugh lulu , they say the best medicine is laughter !! hope work was ok ? i'm still doing short days and it's going ok. i've booked some time off end of august and hope i'll be feeling better to at least enjoy last bit of summer. i know one thing i won't be forgetting this year in a hurry. goodnight xx",
          "it still seems like we are going to have to put up with the symptoms till they go dane i've waxed the ears felt the oil come back out i still feel the earaches will take time to go we are the same as the australians just read an article from the guardian they're still getting symptoms from march as well mine may be due to the anxiety but i don't think so and when i get reffered back to hospital i will question this again the tension headaches are easing drymouth and throat also tension on neck and shoulder so they are in our club or we in theirs whatever the doctors and nurses say or do looks to me like time is going to be the healer gary",
          "*morning lulu i have waxed the ears and will carry on with it for the rest of the week but i already feel i will still get the earaches after now that i have a referral i think that when i go to the hospital i will find that there are going to be a lot more people still recovering from the virus due to the same as us we don't see like before the last patient coming out etc read an article from guardian the australians have the same issue patients still have symptoms from march not good news i know but we are not the only ones it says that 80 percent of people that left the hospital or are still in the community are still getting symptoms so now i know a little bit of earwax is not causing the problem but now when i go back to the hospital there will be others suffering the same problem and help should be available gary",
          "hi everyone:)that's great you're getting support from surgery now,gary, and hopefully hospital will help with your remaining symptomsmy main symptom at the moment seems to be stomach and i'll have to go back to doctor if it doesn't improve. i think though it's related to what i do, so trying to be careful.is anyone noticing that the good days seem better, and the bad days seem a little less bad? hope i'm not imagining it, trying to be positive!hope it's a good day for everyone",
          "morning joanne yes i think you are right we are improving very slowly but certain symptoms are taking a lot longer maybe that's because we had them a long time i'm hoping after the referral i will know exactly how much longer i have to wait before all symptoms are gone i will let everyone know be careful with your stomach gary",
          "i think so jo i went back to work two weeks ago and when i look back i feel much better in myself now than i did then - and i'm hoping in another two weeks will look back on today and think that i am feeling even better - it is so hard to gauge how you are progressing as very up and down and progress, as we all know too well, is slow. did a really long walk at lunch time extremely hilly and very hot and breathing was a bit laboured and right lung felt a bit weird think it has a bit of mucus build up but overall feel much better in myself - think sorting the sore throat has really helped - it is much better than it was (famous last words!!)enjoy the weekend and the sunshine.lx",
          "i know what you mean gary sometimes the medical profession are trying to find a simple diagnosis but in your heart you know it is more complex than that - the wax was probably making it worse but would think more likely linked to the inflammation in respiratory tract - think that is why i have tinnitus - specialist told me it was anxiety but tbh i am not feeling particularly anxious any more. i do think if they don't know how to treat something the anxiety diagnosis seems to be the answer and its very hard to argue with that.anyway you will get more answers from hospital and really hope you feel things are improving for you and try not to be anxious, if you are, everything will work out it has just been such a long haul.lx",
          "yes i agree lulu doctors seem to always look for the easy solution i am certain that the ear will still ache after the wax is gone i'm cool with the anxiety i have got the tingling under control but tension headaches come as a package with the earaches hopefully they will be able to help with the throat and dry mouth at the referral we all need a way back for this to end gary",
          "don't we just gary.fingers crossed the end is in sight.",
          "we certainly do jim can't wait to see the back of it now mate i hope you are getting somewhere gary",
          "mucus on the chest, lump in throat, blocked nose and tired. there's improvement but small.doctors on monday afternoon for a spirometer test again but with a nebuliser this time.hospital next friday for seven day ecg.specialist telephone call on the 3rd of august.its all go and no answers. lol",
          "*it's not good jim i know i have had enough of it and i know you have and it certainly has taken time to get help that we should have had ages ago let's hope it is over soon gary *",
          "when i spoke to the really nice gp i told her exactly that gary. i explained we all felt let down not by the staff per se but by the system, government etc.she couldn't argue.",
          "so true hopefully now we can get over the line and finish with this soon as possible gary",
          "hi all it's strange that none of us suffered from anxiety before we got ill it must be part of the virus as everyone like us have had the same. jim so glad your starting to get the care and support you need let's hope you get answers. looking back all my gp did was talk to me apart from going to the hospitals i haven't had any other follow ups etc. i did get 2 lots of antibiotics and given the tablets but never checked at gps just left to get on with it. each week i'm improving now fingers crossed it continues. glad the lansoprazole are working lulu. hope your ok gary.",
          "hi lulu been on the beach today with my dog we went in for a paddle having my granddaughter over tomorrow so will be making cakes, playing dolls and playing in paddling pool lol.",
          "hi susanso glad you are improving and sounds like the perfect weekend ahead. always think of you walking on the beach - shame we were away last week and not this week with the sunshine.do you have any symptoms still or have they all subsided now?lx",
          "hi susan,thank you for those kind words.how long have you been suffering?dud you ever have mucus on your chest and were you able to get it up?",
          "hi jim and lulu i still get the mucas i clear my throat and it goes also still get odd headache, glands ache and earache at times but don't feel so fatigue as i use to tho, think that's the vitamins i'm taking also now of the meds which made me tired. my breathing is ok now as well its just a time thing we all will get better let's hope they find a vaccine soon at least it will help people.",
          "morning,how is everyone today?what is the weather like where you are?",
          "morning jim weather lovely here, going to get a paddling pool in bit for granddaughter nixie. i'm ok today how r you?",
          "that sounds lovely.we've wind and rain.feeling ok at the moment.how are you?",
          "good morning everyoneso pleased you're getting some support at last jim, hope it's helpful for you. hope you have a good dayyou've got the best weather then, susan, it's a bit dull here. hope you have a lovely day with your granddaughter that's good sore throat is easing, lulu and you're gradually feeling better. it's definitely very slow progress. enjoy your weekendhope you enjoy your break from work, gary, and have a relaxing weekendi think it'll be a restful weekend for me, daughter will probably come over tomorrow and maybe facetime with family sometime. i'll keep up the walking, i find it really helpful, i feel so much better afterwards. just no hills for a bit!happy weekend everyone! :)",
          "**hi jim i'm ok thanks woke up with a dry throat achy today but gone now. i'm a big paranoid at mo my cat before he died must have brought a mouse in found it dead, pulled out sofa the other day and found droppings i hoovered them up but didn't realise you shouldn't do that. now i'm panicking i'm going to get a desease from them lol i'm sure i'll be ok, we live next to a field so they are a nitemare we have poisons down behind cupboards. hi joanne hope your ok as well everyone enjoy their weekend \ud83c\udf1e\ud83c\udf1e\ud83c\udf1e",
          "hi everyone i don't know whats going on been dealing with this anxiety issues and now only getting sharp pains in the middle of my back not sure what that's all about one thing after another hope no one else has new symptoms gary",
          "aup gary,sorry to hear you've a new symptom pal.other than that, how are you?i've managed a couple of walks round the block in the wind and rain. nuts hey.we will get there gary.",
          "other than that good jim that's good that you went around the block a couple of times you use that as a marker jim keep improving on it don't matter about the weather i've got the tingling down and the tension headaches are getting there don't understand why the middle of the back is hurting though weird hopefully they'll tell me at the referral keep improving jim we gotta get across the line gary",
          "we will cross the line gary my pal, we will!",
          "hi everyone!it is a lovely sunny day here \ud83d\ude0e felt pretty good last few days throat less sore, chest a bit tight but overall quite good. think the laryngitis is going to take a while to clear up completely can feel the sore throat lingering in the background but the meds are helping. feel much better in myself and have more energy.sounds like everyone is doing well. your walks are progressing jim, keep at it that is exactly what i did just a add a few hundred yards each day and before you know it you are doing a couple of miles! gary i still get all sorts of random pains in back/chest etc. have to remember the lungs are still healing. there is probably still mucus and residue in the lungs which over time will clear - i sometimes feel that the mucus has moved - i still get pain in my right lung which was worse affected. jo/susan really hope you enjoy your weekend with daughter and granddaughter - so nice to be able to do \"normal\" family things and take your mind of all our medical ailments!enjoy the rest of day everyone.lx",
          "thanks lulu i wasn't sure it's annoying me i went for a really long walk and could feel it in my back besides that getting somewhere i think we got the sore throat for a little while yet dry mouth still but sleeping better onward christian soldiers \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "yeah wouldn't worry too much gary reckon it's just the body doing its healing - think we're kinda of out of the eye of the storm we've just got to hang on in there a bit longer and not overdo it. progress is slow but it is happening.ha! onward christian soldiers, it does feel a bit like we've been to battle doesn't it?! i am so glad i didn't know 4 months ago what lay ahead - i stupidly believed it was just going to be a couple of weeks of mild flu \ud83d\ude44take care,lx",
          "i still laugh at the flu like symptoms when i read a book i've got the letter from the hospital as a book marker so i don't lose it progress is certainly slow lulu but it is getting better enjoy the rest of your evening gary",
          "i have to agree lulu. the first paramedic who came to my home on the 6th of april said to me, make it passed day ten, that's when it really goes wrong. then i had doctors saying it's going to be two weeks, then four. after that it was eight and twelve.just proves they've no idea how long it'll take. however, we're over the worst of it and on the final straight.",
          "hi i'm glad we didn't know what was ahead of us but hopefully they know more about the virus now then they did. i still think we shoukd have gone in for observation when we were all so breathless and tight chested rather then being left at home.",
          "totally agree susan.your oxygen level had to be below 93% to be taken in up here.",
          "and now 18 is the magic number think gary and i only have a week or two to get our act together ..\ud83d\ude02",
          "morning guys,hope everyone is well this morning,the sun is out here in god's county and fingers crossed it is where you are.",
          "morning jimthink the weather we had yesterday has reached you it is cloudy and dull in london today!how you feeling? how's the mucus coming along? mine is much less but then i worry in case it is still there and not coming up and will cause chest tightness that is the worst symptom for me it scares me if chest goes tight or maybe after all this time am just producing less which means things finally improving.enjoy the sunshine!lx",
          "hi lulu,i'm much the same with mucus. sometimes i can expel a lot but others hardly anything. it's a question i'm going to put to my gp on monday and if i don't get a satisfactory answer i'll put it to the consultant the next week.this morning i've done breathing exercises, taken mucodyne and had a 15 minute walk at normal walking pace and hardly got anything up? bizzare.today is the second day of feeling a tad better, thank you. i've still got symptoms though but we all have.are you okay?jim.",
          "morning all early birds i was up early didn't go out till a bit later because i'm not in gods county jim it was raining i'm pleased to say that the head tension and earaches are easing i'm getting tension on the bridge of my nose where i had the problem at the start comes and goes besides that and neck and shoulder which doesn't bother me i'm starting to feel a lot better lulu we have just passed week 17 so may be 18 is the magic number god i hope so jim keep it up can see improvement from you as well gary",
          "hi all hope your all well today? i'm feeling tired today think i over did it with granddaughter yesterday we were busy all day having a quiet day only been to dinasaur park and baking cakes and on way dropping nixie off were getting macdonalds takeaway and eating on beach.",
          "so glad you are beginning to feel better jim reckon you have turned the corner. i did read that the body has to rid itself of the residue in the lungs, basically the mucus, and it is quite a mammoth task so presumably it takes a long time but be interested to hear what your doc says as to why some days more than others. i am cutting down on the mucodyne i was taking 6 a day, then 3 and now i am down to 2. i met a work friend today, talked non-stop for 4 hours and now i have the fire in windpipe feeling - think jo described it as that and it is perfect description. she hadn't seen me for 4 months, said how well i looked but could tell i was \"not quite right\"! enjoy rest of day, lx",
          "me too gary am feeling a lot better in myself - i feel more stable (how to jinx things!) and more energy. my larynx and throat still need to heal but that is going to take time and i need to stop talking which is easier said than done! i also get a lot of pressure in my nose but i reckon that is because of the whole respiratory tract being inflamed and sensitive. anyway let's see where we are at week 18 - we might have to request an extension for a couple of more weeks if we are not recovered! tbh i don't think we are going to wake up week 18 and say that's it job done i am hoping will be at a point where we are recovered enough to do pretty much everything but with room for improvement and continued recovery. i honestly think it is still going to take a while to get rid of all the symptoms.lx",
          "agreed lulu i think we will have to wait for a few more weeks yet but same as feel a lot better than before been out with friends and had a couple of pints hopefully will not backfire on me and can get up in the morning \ud83d\ude02 for a easy day got days again this week before i start back on nights next week god not looking forward to that never know all symptoms could be gone by then gary",
          "hi gary should you be going back on nights yet?",
          "hi susan i should be ok if it is a problem my friend's will help me though it or i can switch back to days sorted with the office gary",
          "good lad gary.please let me know how the beer effects you tomorrow.i'm parched, as i haven't had a drink in months.",
          "i know that feeling jim if it was a few hours later it might be a problem but i hope i will be fine i wasn't when i had a couple of bottles of peroni last time but that was a few weeks ago hoping you can neck a couple of pints soon jim might wash away the mucus gary",
          "hi gary and all,sounds a lot more positive on here reading all your posts. glad you managed to get out with friends gary, bet it felt great being able to do something normal and fun.i've had a lovely weekend, felt pretty decent, bumped into an old school friend outside my house and learnt she lives down my road! been eating whatever i fancy and it's put me in a better mood. today i took nearly teenage daughter to a clothes shop and managed fine and then went to parliament hill with everyone and all enjoyed. my eyes got sore after, a little tired when got home and a bit of body aches but it felt so good to be out and about and not feel awful.tomorrow is magic 18 week for me, but even if the little sugar spell isn't broken for me yet i'm still grateful for the little improvements.wishing you all a very good night and continued good news from everyone!",
          "that is great news asas well dane things are going well for us and hopefully soon this little sugar nightmare will be over with just woke up dry but had a good weekend enjoy the start of a new week gary",
          "that's brilliant news dane so glad you enjoyed the weekend. i know any restrictive diet puts me in a bad mood!! so nice to go shopping too i really miss clothes shopping but always did quite a bit online anyway but am gradually getting back out there. i look back and am coughing much less now and overall feel much better just my throat bit sore and chest not quite right i'm going 91/2 this week back up from 9!have a great day everyone hope you're ok gary and your beers yesterday didn't come back to bite you?! lx",
          "morning,that's a good score lulu, 91/2 is great.well, the sun is out here and looks as though today will be a classic summer's day.been for a quick walk, 10 minutes 950 steps. don't know whether it's average or not but didn't get out of breath.just about to do my breathing exercises, they're so mundane.doctor's later.hope everyone has a good day.jim.ps anyone heard from maciek?",
          "hi everyone :)that sounds impressive jim, a lot of steps in 10 mins.good luck at doctorsgreat you're back up again lulu, it seems things are getting better for some of us, hopefully more of us as the weeks go byi can't believe it's 4 months today since i got the dreaded sore throat! i think it may be the magic 20 weeks for me, when i'll be well on the way to recovery. i'm going up to 8 1/2 this week as i'm feeling so much better. i've still got the stomach issues slowing me down, and nose/ears/throat stuff going on, but hopefully that'll improve.have a good day",
          "yep time flies jo and hopefully we are having more fun than we all were a couple of months ago! i think we might need to change the magic number from 18 to 20 weeks me and gary are nearly at 18 and still have symptoms! so good you are up to 81/2 i'm so pleased you are feeling so much better - is your throat still sore? i still feel like i have a head cold - it's not so bad if i am just pottering around but builds up if i exercise. i wake up in the morning feeling really bunged up. the lanzoprazole has helped a lot but think i need to rest my vocal chords but finding that tricky as see friends most days!i have booked an outside yoga class weds first one since early march! - it will be pretty tough 1.5 hours but will just do what i can. the outdoor pool where i normally swim also opening saturday but am going to give that a miss until after the school holidays finished as be full of kids peeing in it all day and don't really fancy that at the moment! lx",
          "morning jim!that's brilliant you are really cracking on now - so pleased you are making progress and the 950 steps/10 mins is great and something to build on each day and so good you didn't get out of breath think that is definitely the way to go - i always push myself too hard have done so right from the start and never learn my lesson but i guess we are all different and also depends on what your fitness was before we became sick. i reckon it is much better to do little and often and not put your lungs under too much strain. i do that stacking breathing exercise when you inhale a little at a time hold it and then inhale a bit more and so on until lungs are full and then hold it again - can't remember who told me that one - it could well have been you!! i like it as can do anywhere/any time and do it watching telly in evening and throughout day.let us know how you get on at docs - be interested to hear what his take is on the ongoing mucus production - will it ever end?!no not heard from maciek maybe back at work?lx",
          "hello lulu (and everyone) thanks so much for your reply and i must apologise for taking so long to thank you. i have been on a bit of a low and have been hiding from the world these last few days unfortunately, i didn't even feel like i had the energy to write. pretty annoying and silly. i'm just so fed up - as i'm sure everyone is.i found your laryngitis diagnosis very interesting and informative. it's made me think of some of my symptoms differently. i have been noticing that for weeks now every evening a low buzzy headache comes on with tight breathing, cough, nasal congestion and constant lump in throat/mucus clearing - all at the same time! it's been driving me mad. i realised that the common theme is that i've had my big evening meal beforehand and i've now noticed that the same thing happens whenever i eat but to a lesser degree during the day. laryngitis doesn't quite fit for me as i haven't had a sore throat but i have found there is something called laryngopharyngeal reflux which almost matches all my symptoms except i don't have the heartburn type symptoms. i have since found there is another version of it called 'silent reflux' and i think it matches all my symptoms quite well. it's silent because the stomach acid is causing problems but without the telltale signs of burning or indigestion stuff. it can cause headaches and breathing difficulties too.i have put up with nasal and throat congestion for years so maybe it has been triggered more by the virus. whether this is what i have i don't know. the next step is to call my gp but i'll be honest, i think i have developed a fear of them! they send me into anxiety and frustration and don't seem to listen to me, so i keep putting off the call. what a mess!!i've been taking the gaviscon you mentioned as i already had some and i'm monitoring the results.i'm not saying that this diagnosis i have come up with will end me feeling ill but it might alleviate some of it. anyway thanks so much lulu for your input as it has possibly put me onto something that i couldn't identify before. i hope the medication you are taking does the trick and i hope everyone here is well soon. sorry for rambling about my symptoms. big hugs to all. stuart",
          "hi stuartsorry you have been so down and feeling rubbish - that is exactly what the specialist diagnosed laryngopharyngeal reflux - i couldn't remember the medical name when i posted on here. so the lanzoprazole was prescribed with the gaviscon advance. he did say you probably had it prior to this but because of the inflammation in respiratory tract it has exacerbated it and it wouldn't have bothered you too much before but i too felt quite bunged up in mornings. i have to say i feel much better since starting lanzoprazole and mucus is better and lump in throat. as you say i was never aware of having this as you don't have heart burn with silent reflux. really hope the doctor listens to you this time, definitely give him/her a call.lx",
          "hi lulu thanks for your reply. how's your breathing now since the medication? i will call the doc but i think i need to change surgeries first. i have a blood test to do first so i'll wait until after that. all the best. ps, anyone else struggling to use the forum? it freezes all the time for me and it has taken 20 minutes just to try and copy and paste this into the box! \ud83d\ude02",
          "hi stuartsorry you are so unwell. i think i've got some sort of acid reflux too, it seems to be quite common with this virus. the doctor's given me omeprazole which has really helped. i think you might be able to get it without a prescription.maybe the gaviscon will help though.yes i often have problems posting but i thought it was my phone. it won't let me use emojis either.hope you're feeling better soon",
          "hi luluoutside yoga sounds fun! my yoga class is online now and i keep hoping i'll be able to join in soon. at the moment an hour would be too much, so i think i'll have to wait until september, after the summer break. i've got a huge list of things i'm going to do in september! yes my sore throat is still lurking in the background. it's not really painful but sometimes tickles or my voice goes croaky when i've been talking a lot. i've just discovered that my ears are extra-sensitive to noise, and they are often buzzing or ringing.oh well hope all these will disappear soon with everything elseenjoy your evening x",
          "evening everyone,i have just returned from the doctors and she was truly honest during my appointment,she said no one can give a timeline on recovery nor whether we would totally recover from all of our symptoms, as covid is a new disease.however, she was optimistic that we would return near to our baseline.as for the mucus, she listened to my chest, which she said she could not hear any whistling or crackling, so it could be lung, throat or stomach. she further said that she doubted we would be rid of the mucus completely.sorry i know that doesn't help me it is what it is.",
          "hi jimi think the bottom line is gps just don't know enough about this and are therefore very vague - \"it could, it might, maybe\" we've all been hearing this. when i asked my gp about cutting down on mucodyne he said \"you could try it and see what happens\" - not that helpful a response!my thinking is this is a coronavirus the same as the common cold, flu etc. but obviously for some of us much more extreme symptoms and on the basis how far we have come i am confident we will fully recover but reckon will take time, you can only see the progress by keep looking back and comparing what you were like several weeks ago. it is also confusing as some days much better than others and on the bad days its easy to feel all doom and gloom - i was literally like this last monday today i feel pretty good even though sinus is completely blocked today and head feels like it could explode. we won't get rid of the mucus completely - everyone has mucus in their throat and nose so she was right there! - just not as much as us at the moment (!) and again i think it will gradually lessen. i am finding gps to be more and more useless lately unless you have an ingrown toe nail or something similar - my father in law was a gp and was first class and was highly respected by his patients but that was a long time ago now.sorry it wasn't more helpful for you but hopefully your hospital appointment will be. lx",
          "think your symptoms are similar to mine jo, my ears are buzzing all the time too and sinus is bad today.am wondering whether the yoga might be a bit premature but will give it a go! will let you know thursday! think probably sensible to wait until september and i'm definitely not going to swim till then. lx",
          "maybe having problems positing because we need to move on to a new page - we need gary's permission to do that otherwise we will all get lost like last time and he had to round us up again \ud83d\ude02think my breathing is better overall, only started lansoprazole last weds and throat feels much better too but am really suffering sinus problems today - walked in the forest for over an hour this morning so wondering if it is hay fever - never suffered from hay fever in my life but seem to now - amongst many other things! i think the bottom line is our whole respiratory system has been f***** (sorry couldn't think of a more polite word!) by this illness and is going to take a long time to recover but i am confident it will in time.hope you pick up again soon, keep in touch.lx",
          "hi lulu,i totally agree with you, they've no idea and as you say there are numerous similarities to the common cold, so yes we will recover. i firmly believe that.unfortunately, i'm one of those that need answers but in our case they can't give any.like you say i can't wait for my consultant to organise a ct scan asap because that'll answer questions.one thing i did take away from her, which everyone has said on here. we must be positive.take care,jim.",
          "lulu,have you trued avmays nasal spray on prescription? it's supposed to be good.i'm currently trying it.",
          "no will ask gp for that my nose is so blocked. thanks jim x",
          "hi lulu and all,yes they don't make them like they used to. my dad was also a brilliant gp, in the community where he worked they still talk about him like he passed away last week and it's been nearly 16 years. i remember how he used to pace the kitchen thinking about his patients and then going to make phone calls to arrange for whatever he concluded to do, he would call up the hospital when referring a patient telling them exactly what they needed to do so it would be ready when the patient arrived and they always listened to him. no messing around. i thought all gps were like that as didn't know any different, alas it's not the case...on a more positive note, had a call from specialist at barnet, a very long call, he went through the whole story and said there are some things like muscle aches, breathlessness, fatigue which are classic post viral and not to worry. the symptoms which are a bit odd and could be followed up are the reflux and strange pulses i have. he is going to meet with the post covid team which consists of neurologist, cardiologist, physiotherapist, psychologist and respiratory specialist to discuss what help i need and he will suggest at the meeting to do an endoscopy and 24 hr ecg and see about anything else. he also said that previously they had no information about prognosis for long term post covid but now he says they do have evidence of full recovery so he expects that all will be ok...so that's good news! he also said that having looked at all blood tests and xrays since march, results show recovery. i asked him why there's no gastro on the recovery team to deal with reflux issues and he said it's because none of the admitted patients showed signs of reflux or gi issues, i told him i know lots of people (you guys) that have reflux as post covid symptom to which he replied i have access to a broader range of people so it may be the case, but they in the hospital haven't seen it as an issue. anyway they meet next week and we'll see. i have a hope i'll be fully recovered after all this time and won't need all these ologists!feeling a bit sore on chest today but otherwise roughly ok.",
          "ha! your dad sounds amazing as was my fil- just so caring and thorough!such positive news and great that he will liaise with all the right specialists on your behalf. the reflux diagnosis is a weird one - i remember seeing people mention that on here and i was thinking what has stomach reflux got to do with this respiratory illness?! but diagnosis for me must be right as throat has improved so much since taking the medication. it seems the main issue is the inflammation of throat/larynx from the virus which would, in normal circumstances clear up quite quickly, but because of severity of the inflammation the reflux, which would not usually cause a problem, is continuously aggravating it and stopping it healing.i've had a big sneezing fit (much to partner's delight as he is trying to watch the golf\ud83d\ude44) and nose feels a bit better now \ud83d\ude02great you have this specialist on board and he is meeting post covid team sounds hopeful you will get more answers next week. it's all sounding positive!lx",
          "dane,brilliant news, thank you for sharing.the news regarding a full recovery was heart warming too.",
          "it's funny how you get a diagnosis that helps connect the dots. my chest has started to feel sore since going off the diet which i'm guessing is the reflux. happy your sneezing fit has helped, life's little pleasures eh :) specialist was good i liked his approach, very detailed and to the point and no fluff.",
          "yes jim that was the best detail of the conversation and i know he was saying it from a point of knowledge and evidence, very encouraging!",
          "morning all ive got good news the tension headaches and earaches have eased right down the tingling hands have as well got some tension across the bridge of my nose and struggling with my eyes on a phone a lot so i have tension on my neck and shoulder and dry mouth taking its time to heal i suppose no fatigue any more don't struggle at work and the lads told me when i go on to nights when the work is done we can do one result come on everyone let's get over the line i am reading lots of positive not had my referral yet don't know how that works should have asked her when it might be enjoy your day 18 weeks friday hoping for the tension to be gone by then gary",
          "brilliant news gary.well done to no fatigue!",
          "that's great gary.glad you are having some improvements.i ran out of my ranitidine and have had a few bad days of tight chest and mucous production.trying to get in touch with docs again to prescribe some more and also ask about winter.am really concerned about going into winter with my lungs not in great shape. i always pick up colds and brochial stuff easily so worried about not being in top form for that.",
          "hi res,funnily enough my gp brought that up at my appointment yesterday afternoon.she said to eat well, rest, avoid crowded places, vitamin supplements c, d, zinc and cold liver oil and remember good hand hygiene.so exactly what we're doing now.she did say we would be prone to infection due to the battle our bodies have fought this year.",
          "i know jim feeling a lot better for it i remember when i went back to work last time only done a little bit of work and it put me on my back side for two days they have helped me a lot at work to be honest and hopefully can get over the line in a few weeks i hope you're going to get there soon as well jim at least most of doctors and specialists know more now about bloody time gary",
          "hi res thats not good running out of the ranitidine i know what you mean about the winter it's scary enough going to work with out worrying about your health problems which most of us have now i hope doctors sorts you out and you can be ready hibernation would be good for us gary",
          "hi joanne, thanks for your words. i'm feeling better today, hopefully it continues!i don't think it's your phone that is the problem with the lag , i have just switched to my old laptop as the forum has become unusable on my phone, and it lags on the laptop too. i think it's because we are all posting on one page.hope you are feeling well soon. take care.",
          "hi lulu , yes the page needs changing i think as i tried writing on page 71 and it works fine - no lag. i tried responding to you yesterday but had to give up as this page just wasn't responding and i ended up losing my patience (in short supply these days unfortunately). i'm having more success on the laptop though. you might want to try sterimar for your nose problems. i'm not saying it's a cure but it certainly helps me. there are different types for congestion/ hayfever etc. i have all of them but that's no surprise as i seem to have become a walking medicine cabinet!i agree about our respiratory system being ******, but i'm sure we'll get there. it's just not something we are used to dealing with.how long are you supposed to be taking the lansoprazole for, if you don't mind me asking?",
          "hello dane , thanks so much for posting this news. its just the kind of medicine we need. it put a smile on my face for sure!was the specialist through nhs or private?thanks again : ))",
          "hi res , sorry to hear that. hopefully your doc can give you some famotidine instead.had you noticed your breathing get worse after eating, pre taking the ranitidine? i'm asking as it happens to me and think there must be a connection with reflux/silent reflux and breathing/asthma like symptoms etc. maybe i'm chasing shadows but it does seem that h2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors might play some part in relieving symptoms. i hope you get back to feeling well again soon. all the best.",
          "hi stuart,yes he was from nhs. good news for sure, just what we need to keep going, there's a light at the end of the tunnel.res, i think stuart has a point there, maybe worth trying a ppi or even gaviscon for now. famotidine not so easy to come by i had mine sent over from abroad, and only 20mg which just helps take the edge off the reflux symptoms. we all seem to be having issues with this having thought our problems were respiratory but some of us have found relief using ppi's.",
          "unfortunately for me ppi's won't work as its not acid reflux i am having issues with ( although ironically i used to have non acid reflux and gastroparesis)what the randomise helped me with was tight chest and cough.",
          "yes, rather scary! well, forewarned is forearmed as they say!",
          "i seriously am thinking of hibernating![](https://)",
          "hi stuart, everyonehappy to change page - maybe at the end of this week so people know and can't find us!i will check our sterimar - amazing the meds we have collected on this journey! i am taking lansoprazole until i see consultant on 1 september - he did say didnt think i needed long term treatment.does anyone else find they feel like have a head cold and my eye muscles are achy by end of day or when i am tired - anyone else found this?!glad you are feeling better stuart. lx",
          "brilliant news gary, me too bridge of nose feels tight and eyes are achy. hope work is going well. i had a pretty good day to day so things definitely getting easier.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu it is hard to comprehend how hard it is to stay with it i've been out with friends drinking and socialising and am home now and feeling like i shouldn't have done it and may pay for it in the morning gary",
          "just get an early night and take it easy - don't over do it at this stage!lx",
          "good lad!!!you'll be fine gary.",
          "people been mentioning why quite a few of us have the reflux issue with a respiratory illness - i have just had a copy of letter that the ent specialist sent to my doctor. he said the role stress has on reflux is quite significant. this probably explains why quite few of us suffering from the reflux problems!lx",
          "that's interesting lulu, it explains why a lot of us have got some sort of reflux.i wondered whether it was all that coughing up of mucus as well.yes i've got the watery stingy eyes and runny nose, like a cold. i usually wear contact lenses but i've only managed to wear them a couple of times in the last few months.hope everyone is having better days.sorry you've not been well res, hope you manage to get the medication you need",
          "hi joyes he mentioned the coughing too. i have the symptoms of a cold but don't feel like i have a cold - it is all so strange! my eyes are achy and nose blocked but have actually felt quite well today - chest and breathing has been better but i didn't do a long walk today - wonder if i have been overdoing it on the walking might cut it down a bit - when i think about it a hilly 4 mile walk is quite a lot even if you are well - think it might put too much strain on lungs and throat. might take it easy for a week or two and just potter around and see what happens - it seems to be trial and error as to what helps and what doesn't! lx",
          "hi everyone glad to hear some gd news, especially gary out socialising well done you !! i've spoken to my gp today and mentioned someone i knew with ongoing symptoms had been prescribed lansoprazole and said it was relieving symptoms. so she's prescribed me omeprazole not sure if it's same thing, thanks again lulu. the gp said she could refer me to the covid hub for rehabilitation but she's confident i don't need it and will get better in time but it may take 6 months !! the weather's defo agreeing with me though but still feeling really achy first thing in morning and like lulu mentioned still feel like i've got a cold. good evening everyone.",
          "hi stephi'm taking omeprazole too, from doctor. i think they're similar, not sure what the difference is. hope it helps you.that's good you're feeling better, i am too, just trying to be careful not to do too much.i think the 6 months, hopefully, is when we'll be totally recovered, and we'll gradually improve more and more until then. fingers crossed!",
          "hi stephthink lansoprazole and omeprazole are same family of drugs - be interested to know if make any difference to you, i really hope so, let us know what you think in a few days. i actually felt better after a couple of days. six months does sound about right - some of us are over 4 months already! i wonder what the cold thing is about? that has come on more recently for me - i seem to remember having it several weeks ago and then it went away. god this is such a weird illness - it just makes you so nervous as you never really know what is going to happen next! let's hope it is all over by 6 months and we are back to good health before the autumn. lx",
          "hi lulu and joanne, yes between us all we're all on different meds just hoping to get the magic one to kick this little \"sugar\" to the kerb !! oh just to say the gp did say maybe cut down on caffeine as some people said it helped symptoms. don't know about everyone else but i love my cuppa, so maybe that's where i'm going wrong. who knows what's going on inside our bodies it's all a big mystery, thanks covid !!",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've been reading the posts last time i went to a and e i got prescribed omeprazole so it must be acid reflux i rode a bike yesterday went to get one from a friend only a mile away but coming back i felt all my symptoms may be because i have only been walking before the tension headaches and earaches across my neck and shoulder and lungs it's all there getting better but feeling it will be a while yet no fatigue this morning have to have water with me at work dry mouth mostly night but there during the day i will cycle more the weekend see if its much better its certainly been a shift and a half this little sugar should have given me overtime for it gary",
          "morning everyonethink that's right gary it is only when you do something new you realise you are not quite better - i did a long walk in the heat last friday and felt rough after and breathing was bad - just a reminder not to push it too hard but we are gradually doing more and more normal stuff and it's brilliant how you have progressed with work and everything. am off to my outside yoga class felt weird putting my yoga gear on as last time i wore it was the morning i realised i was properly ill - so many bad memories of those dark days think definitely affects you mentally but hey i am going, i look well, i feel pretty well a little bit of mucus this morning, bit of tinnitus and nose a bit blocked but overall pretty damn good!! - am going to take it super easy it is a tough class but i will do what i comfortably can and will be moaning when i can't walk and breathe tomorrow!i've cut right down on caffeine steph - i do miss it but trying to drink mainly water at the moment and yeah \"thanks covid \" (made me laugh!).lx",
          "yes i guess lulu it is there just got to make sure that i don't over do it got a phone call from ent specialist went through everything told me lots of other people have been through the same different symptoms for different people said to go back to steam water and towel even though i don't get a lot of mucus i can feel it don't cough it up steam it basically so will do that tension on the bridge of my nose will go in time and like you said lulu throat same she is going to ring again in 4 weeks so she must know it taking time gary",
          "hi all,looks like the systems down your neck of the woods works better than up here gary.when i saw my gp yesterday i mentioned i hadn't heard from the respiratory team at the hospital. she checked and it had been chased last week but there wasn't any answer, so she did it again whilst i was there.i received an appointment this morning for a respiratory physiotherapy appointment on the 21st of september. quite a wait.because of the physiotherapy appointment i rang the appointment number for the nhs consultant and have been told they are now triaging the triage list, which i'm on. they'll call me when there's an appointment. i am so glad i made the appointment with the private consultant.glad your doing so well gary. really pleased for you.jim.",
          "it's not good jim ain this day and age it takes so long i still don't get it i'm glad i changed my gp just you hang in there and do what we've been doing most of it ourselves looking like time is the only healer we are going to get have you been walking again jim i know that will help gary",
          "hi gary,yes pal, we've been well and truly screwed over by the system. when i think of how much we'll have paid in over the years. i've had two short walks today round the block. it works out to a thousand steps each time and i do it in ten minutes each time.jim.",
          "i know jim well and truly screwed have to deal with it ourselves gary",
          "hi jim so glad you're getting your steps in and improving. good for the mind and soul. yes think we've all been failed medically one way or another !! we've been our own medical experts who would've guessed it, dr jim , dr steph, dr lulu lool etc.....lulu hope yoga went ok and it didn't bring back bad memories. i still hate being in my bedroom too long as it brings back bad memories. the sun's shining so i'm outside topping up my staycation tan. hope you're all having a good day.",
          "hi steph,i am the same regarding the bedroom thing. none of my family understand why i totally avoid going or being in my bedroom(can't stand it). i tired to explain to them that after six weeks and nearly dying in there it brings back bad memories.hope your well. week 16 tomorrow.jim.",
          "yes totally agree jim they were dark times. wow 16 weeks 4 months of this little s**t . i'm ok still got the swollen glands and bunged up feeling of having a cold but hopefully that will all clear up soon. how's you doing ? sounds like you're improving.",
          "hi steph,as with everyone this crap comes and goes. i have had good days since saturday and had the opportunity to do some walking. not much but some.i'm sleeping better too.just think ten more weeks it'll be six months and we should be symptom free.",
          "doesn't seem there is any magic potion other than time to get over this - doctors make suggestions but all things we are either doing or have done! yoga went well was lovely to be outside in the sunshine and i kept up - had one coughing fit but that was it! had friend over for lunch and have probably overdone it but had a really nice normal day!i have the same feeling with the bath - when i was really ill i'd run a bath to try and relax and within 5 mins of being in there felt like couldn't breathe and jump out again and come downstairs - not had a bath since! so many bad memories that no-one would understand unless been through it.hope you get an nhs appointment jim but good to have the private one also booked in too - just unbelievable how useless the support has been.hope your tan is coming on well steph - i look like i've been in the south of france for 3 months - makes it even trickier telling people how ill you've been when you now look so well! lx",
          "hi lulu, yeah change page when suits you all, that's cool. it's a shame it has become such a pain to use as i can't just make a quick comment anymore so i keep off. it was fine until they changed the notification process i think.concerning the head cold thing, i've had the feeling of a cold several times, in fact i'd say i feel like i have a chest cold most of the time but without it clearing up. i've had the sore aching eyes thing that you mention for sure and headaches. the sterimar won't be a miracle cure lulu but i find it helps to keep me lubricated in the nasal and throat area and gives some relief by clearing out my passages. plus it tastes like seawater - which i quite like!!i'm definitely stronger than i was weeks ago. i remember feeling like a 90 year old when i went for a stroll once and being overtaken by an old couple. now i'm walking a lot further and my pace is almost back to normal. so there are improvements for sure. just need to sort out the headache, nasal stuff and tight chest. i think we'll all get there eventually. hard to believe it will be 18 weeks this friday. what a slog. i hope you have had a good day lulu and everyone and you all have improvements tomorrow.",
          "hi everyonewell done with yoga session, lulu, glad it went well. i'm keeping things steady at the moment, enjoying going out and about locally. i had lots of plans at home for walking further or going on the bus/train but when i set off for my walk, i find that's enough for now. yes i can't believe what little help we have had. whenever i looked up different symptoms it said see your doctor, your doctor will examine /advise you. oh yeah!i don't know where the doctor was hiding when i went to the surgery for my ecg, the nurse said she'd show it him,he could easily have discussed my results with me.anyway rant over, we're getting on ok with little support from them slowly but surely we're getting there :)",
          "hey all,i also have the achy stingy eyes thing and sometimes they get quite red.well done lulu for yoga, sounds like you're really getting there, good for you!i find myself getting nervous to try things like a walk when i'm achy but actually most of the time it's ok.i have a burning chest now :( guess it's the new no diet triggering the reflux. weight going up, it's a catch-2 situation...",
          "hi joanne,having read all the posts today, i've decided to put pen to paper and contact my mp.unless we put our plight to the higher echelons and hold the voted to account a lot more people will suffer, as we have.i'm thoroughly disgusted in how we've been cared for.",
          "that's a good idea, jim. i must too, when i can get my head round it. there's been little or no interest in our health or well being. i thought things would improve now but they're still reluctant to see us even though they know how ill we've been. even dentists are open to patients now. i don't understand why they're not helping us",
          "good news on the weight gain, dane, that's the most important, i think we've all got this reflux thing to deal with. i've decided to give up pineapple juice for now, it was really good with mucus, but not reflux, so i'll see if my stomach is less sore.",
          "good morning everybody it seems like most of us are getting the traffic light eyes again i got tension across my nose so that probably doesn't help it is all easing might leave the strenuous exercise for a few weeks just do the normal work is going good don't have to worry about nights next week they put me on a course for tuesday so i get monday night off i've only got to work wednesday and thursday night i've annual leaved the weekend so after thursday i've got a week off for my body to keep recovering hope you can all start to see the back of it as soon as possible enjoy your day off to work gary",
          "hi gary,sounds like your on the up and up, which is great.stuart suggested moving pages, as posters are having problems.shall we move to page 71?",
          "morning everyone!well survived the yoga and the gassing at lunch time with my friend - felt really tired last night and throat ached and head felt like bursting but am ok this morning other than my nose and head - has anyone else got that sensation of blocked nose/sinus and fuzzy head? i feel if i could sort this out would pretty much be better - was a bit coughy too last night but can cope with that - seems like every couple of day the mucus builds up a bit but it is nothing like before so all good news.how's your chest dane? good news weight going up now will give you more stamina - i have put on all the weight i lost and a bit more - will be on a diet soon!! i think swimming kept me very trim so now i am lazing around more probably need to eat a bit less - have definitely got appetite back which is good news!am working today and tomorrow but its pretty quiet which suits me at the moment gives me a chance to ease back in slowly.everyone happy to change pages tomorrow? i'll post on a new page in the morning or if anyone else wants to do that - if you notice we lose any of the regulars we can send a private message!lx",
          "hi stuarti wonder what the cold thing is about? i think mine might be linked to the larynx as the more i talk the more my head aches!! not an ideal situation for a woman who loves chatting!so glad you are making progress - you sound like you have exactly same symptoms as me (think we pretty much have all along) regarding all the nasal, headache stuff but thankfully my breathing has improved a lot over the last couple of weeks - such a relief and am not noticing the chest tightness. do you have any mucus these days? i have ordered the sterimar so thanks for the tip - weird i know but i quite like the taste of seawater too!going to move pages tomorrow so make sure you stay with us and let us know how you are getting on.are you working at moment? just wondered what stage people are at with going back to work etc.take care,lx",
          "morning lulu,i'm nowhere near going back to work. my doctor signed me off again until 31/8/20 on monday. her estimate for doing my old job is this time next year but like i said to her, other than it being a very physical job i have to pass a physical.the occupational health team have suggested from october doing a couple of hours a day from home on a laptop. not my idea but it'll stop me going to half money.struggling to get up the mucus today.",
          "joanne,just to update you i emailed my local mp last night.it was too long really but i only put in the pertinent points. there's a lot over 16 weeks.only took 45 minutes to type!",
          "hi jimyes it obviously depends what your job is as to how soon can go back - but good if you can do that from october to save going to half money. what do they put on your fitness to work certificate? mine has suspected c-19 as i was never tested. i sometimes wonder if i had health problems in future this would cause a problem - was thinking i have critical illness insurance but pretty sure they wouldn't pay out if i needed to stop working because i was never actually diagnosed with c-19. we definitely fell through the net on all the testing but we can't be the only ones in this situation who have been really ill and not tested. remind me jim were you tested?i am finding with the mucus it is not every day now it is much less but then every few days it seems to build up and needs to be cleared again. it is worse when i have exercised/walked more as much shift it a bit. lx",
          "hi lulu,the occupational health doctor who reviewed me on tuesday said that was her plan to get me back into a routine. my gp had suggested a similar plan at my appointment on monday afternoon, spooky.all of my sick notes say suspected covid 19 respiratory infection.i was tested four times, april and every month afterward. all negative.glad you had fun at the yoga class.",
          "yep have to say having work again on thurs/fri is good for me from routine point of view and makes things feel more normal. ok so your notes say the same, i suppose that is all they can put if no positive test result.off for a walk now am going to take it easy and been rushing about a bit last couple of days!enjoy rest of day jim.lx",
          "hey lulu, everyone hope the warm sun is helping you feel good today (if it's shining where you are!)my chest is sore, from below the collarbone to the neck, it's very achy and constant so not something i could deal with long term will speak to the doc to see what to do. was thinking of trying the ppi again but i am being referred for endoscopy and don't know if that would interfere with results. otherwise, thank g-d, doing better, seems this is my main issue, a bit like you lulu, if this one thing gets sorted i should be back to normal.went to do some shopping on my own this morning and managed fine.thankfully i've been furloughed from work and i think it's til october so that will help take the stress off. i'm working on brushing up skills in the meantime and that helps as a distraction.",
          "hi daneglad things are improving for you and managing to do shopping and normal things. does it feel like inflammation in chest, is it throat too? yes probably best to wait and see what is suggested depending on outcome of endoscopy. i feel like my windpipe has shrunk!! feels tight and the more i talk the tighter it gets - think all to do with the voice box (larynx). will it ever end i ask myself - felt tired and emotional last night and then it all just gets too much for me. thing is as things have improved expectations get higher of how you are feeling - a couple of months ago i would have thought i'd be happy to just have a throat problem but as i have improved i am more aware of what is still not right, if that sort of makes sense!good news re furloughing gives you time to get back on feet.lx",
          "totally get you with the expectations. you get used to feeling better very quickly, that's why this virus has been soooo hard, up and down so much and when a setback comes you panic cos you think, hang on, i felt ok yesterday why am i going backwards?? def notice every minor thing.chest and lower neck feel like inflammation, thought it was muscles at first, but it's so sore all the time and still find i get a bit tight when talking like there's not enough energy in upper body and get aches in my pipes, not sure if wind or food pipe. sore throat happens less often, mainly when tired at night.",
          "my chest was very sore when i inhaled but that has gone now. i feel same with energy and aches and tightness in pipes - i just don't feel right in that department - i think you have to look at improvement over the month rather than weekly as it is so slow.don't forget whoever posts first in the morning to move to a new page! hopefully will help stuart with his lagging issue.lx",
          "hi lulu, everyoneyes it's those last few symptoms, they just don't want to go.apart from the nose/ears/eyes throat, it's been the stomach that's been bothering me. i think it's a lot better without the pineapple juice, and i've stopped having tomatoes too. also i've seen the return of the hot legs/veins, not sure if anyone else has had those. i'm finding keeping cool is helping with that.talking of work, i'm hoping to start again in august. i work for myself (tutoring) so am hoping to do a few hours a week. i have to travel by bus/walk so need to consider that. i'll see how i feel in the next week or so.",
          "hi joyes i was told by the ent guy to stop acidic fruit and tomatoes - i had just had a delivery of about 20 oranges, 10 lemons and loads of tomatoes as had been upping my vit c! not had the hot legs/veins - in fact had few other symptoms other than the lungs and ent - they were enough but maybe i was lucky as others seem to have had more.august sounds like a good bet and hopefully you can start back slowly and build up dependent how you feel. lx",
          "morning guys, the sun is out and the sky blue.my knee isn't bad, which is a miracle after fainting yesterday and going down lack a sack of.....off to the hospital again for a 7 day ecg fitting. that'll make sleeping easier.hope everyone is well.jim.",

          "morning susanglad i am not alone - i think some of it is anxiety and i try not to make a habit of doing it but sometimes if i can't fill lungs once i keep doing it just to check i can breathe! it seems to be worse when the weather is very hot and humid. agree re mask wearing but still good now enforced as should help as we go into autumn hopefully people will get used to it. the problem is people who have not been affected by this or had a family member affected think it is all a fuss about nothing - little do they know. we have friends like this but i have given up trying to explain it is not mild flu or die there is a whole middle ground - like being really sick for months like us.good luck with longer hours next week and yes build up slowly to doing all night. take care, hope you enjoy your day, we too have rain today.lx",
          "hi stuartglad we have sorted out your lagging problems!! i was tested for vit d months ago amazing your gp didn't do that earlier it was highly publicised that low levels of vit d could be a contributory factor - having said that mine were fine so not sure it would have made much difference to your outcome. i am still taking supplements though - anything that might help me and keep me healthy bring it on!am sure you will get back to work but obviously you need lungs to be fully recovered and back to full fitness - it must be so hard when your job requires you to be physically fit luckily for me i look at a pc all day don't need to be fit to do that!throat much better since the lansoprazole and gaviscon but still get the mucus lump feeling, in fact had it badly in the night. am waiting for the sterimar to arrive ordered online a couple of days ago. was just looking at the covid symptom checker app - it has really progressed since back in march/april - i used to complete every day but have stopped but can see how useful it is to keep track of new cases/symptoms etc. so anyone not doing this or have fallen by the wayside take a look it is really helpful. i notice that they now mention the recovery time can be much longer and also mentions gut problems - i am pretty certain i did not have reflux problems before but guess what? i have now!! overall seems things are improving for all of us - a way to go still but am hopeful once you get to a certain point of recovery things will speed up (ever the optimist \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02) surely that has to be a possibility?enjoy your day, so glad you are having more better days, such good news. i was on a call from work found out 4 people came down with c19 - only me who had it badly (bloody typical) but a couple were quite ill for 2/3 weeks but didn't get respiratory problems. lx",
          "stuart, i'm being moderated. think i used bl**dy word ..slap wrist for me! hope posts shortly as it was long reply!!",

          "hi lulu i will do i'm getting the tight chest again i know the doctor at a and e gave me omeprazole obviously lots of reflux goes with this but i think the tension headaches and earaches may go with the tight chest and it may be mucus it has eased the tension but if i do over do it i feel it with the pain in the lungs i never suffered badly with the mucus but it won't go away i will check it out now thank you i checked it out lulu and kept answering told me to get in touch with my gp then i answered the questions and said i still have the symptoms and it told me to get tested then i answered i have both of them negative and then said self isolate etc basically get medical help gary",
          "hahaha, okay naughty lulu \ud83d\ude02what's the symptoms checker on - 111?",
          "hi gary, just wondering when you get the tight chest, is it after eating by any chance?",
          "no because i had it first thing this morning stuart then went for a walk it and it eased same as tension did then it comes back but i'm getting little pains in my back with it lulu said that is the lungs healing gary",
          "ok gary, i just wondered as that is what happens to me after eating. i find walking helps too. hope you feel better.",
          "i think the mucus will slowly clear gary - i read it takes the body a long while to clear it. the covid-19 symptom checker is not going to help us personally or tell us anything we don't know but it is kings college collecting data and they are improving the app all the time and report back to government on figures and numbers of people testing positive and people who are still reporting symptoms so it is a good way to let people know what is going on and help them keep track on the virus - the more people who complete it the better. we do still have symptoms but no need for us to self isolate after all this time! lx",

          "lol yep could think of a lot worse words to use relating to this whole experience!! dowload the c-19 symptom checker on phone (it has been around for months) - tracks data and idea is that you report daily even if you are well so they can collect and analyse symptoms, how long they last etc., new symptoms etc. i still fill it in saying i have mild breathlessness, sore throat and anything else i have that day! there is a space for other information and i put i am recovering since march. i notice now they are mentioning long recovery so presumably other people are completing it who have been ill for months. trouble is most people (me included) complete for a while then stop but after taking a look at it this morning i am going to try and remember to complete every day as we are providing essential information to the ongoing research into this virus. lx",

          "hi joanne i know it's annoying but could be worse we could be 6 weeks back be annoyed then just got to live with it hope we come out the other side and are still here and hopefully normal deal with what we got to and not get p****d off with everyone who says you look ok gary",
          "hi joit is so frustrating and also the not knowing how you are going to feel each day causes anxiety - i get a good idea by around 11.00 how the day will be but it can sometimes take either a downturn or an upturn you just never know what is going to happen next with this!! it is so hard when someone asks how you are - if you say better - that is it ...everyone assumes you are now fine so i normally say am making slow progress but still have a way to go! but as you say gary if you look ok people assume you are. there has been a lot of talk about hidden disabilities relating to mask wearing and does make you realise we can all jump to conclusions about people and their health without knowing all the facts.what a miserable day weather wise. we have a wasp nest up our chimney in the living room just to liven things up \ud83d\ude44lx",
          "that's true, gary you're right. i definitely wouldn't want to go through it again. we're lucky to have got this far,we've just got to be patient",
          "hi luluyes it's hard to plan ahead as we don't know how we're going to feel each day, or as you say, each minute. but the bad days are getting less bad and we've got more idea how to deal with our symptoms. i've had a fairly restful day today, and the steaming and walking does help with clearing the chest.oh dear, wasp nest, that's not good. we had one in the loft a couple of years ago. we had to get the council to come and remove it. he went up and sprayed powder into the loft, and lots of angry wasps came flying out from the roof. was quite amusing to watch!good luck :)",
          "morning everyone looks like a nice day today watch out for the wasps if they are still there lol will be steaming the chest then walking round the park a few times loosen up going to friends later watch the football last games today hope you all have a good day gary",
          "morning all, hope everyone ok today and not suffering to much does anyone get cold like symptoms some days and sore eyes? maybe it's allergies. better day here of to a social distant 1st birthday get to geather in the park hopefully later if it dosnt rain \u2614\u2614",
          "morning susan yes i think lots of us get traffic light eyes red ones i get them and sleep with them in the morning i never suffered with hay fever or anything like that before so it must be part and parcel of the little sugar just been for a walk ive got sudafed night and day for the mucus has anyone else tried it gary",
          "i use beconase spray up my nose and eye drops it does seem to be helping and the lansoprazole, i feel i'm more sensitive to smells, sprays etc now.",
          "morning guys, the sun is out here and looks like it may be a pleasant day weather wise.i've been prescribed avamys nasal spray, which i've personally found better than beconase. a couple of years ago i had my eyes lasered and it caused my eyes to dry during sleep. since then i've use clinitas hydrate gel. that might help with your eyes.as you all know i'm not a doctor so it's not medical advice purely things that have helped me.hope everyone has a good day.",
          "thanks jim i'll look them up. how r u now?",
          "hi susan,the fainting was due to over doing the breathing exercises. all my fault. i've been fortunate i've had a few good days.i'm taking it easy with the walks, gradually increasing the distance. this morning i did 2k steps in 20 minutes and didn't get out of breath.i still have problems with mucus, nasal blocking, fatigue when i over do things.i haven't had a palpitation since the ecg was fitted! hey ho.my gp suggested stopping the mucodyne and inhaler until i see the consultant and have a scan, so i have a baseline to work from.i concur with the spray, smells etc and sensitivity. prior to this i never had asthma, hayfever or any sensitivity at all.how are you?jim.",
          "morning everyone!waspgate continues what a pain in the a**** they have set up home behind the fireplace so no-one can reach them - on second lot of pest control trying to sort it!really pleased you are doing well jim - things are definitely looking up for you and you will just get better and better over next few weeks. take the walking easy and just increase slowly on steps and so good you are not getting breathless. am down to two mucodyne a day and thinking of cutting down to one in the evening.i get the cold symptoms quite regularly susan but then they go again - think worse when it is very warm and humid. it seems we are just more sensitive to everything but reckon that will go off with time. enjoy the birthday party, that sounds fun and weather looking pretty good at moment.we went out last night to friends and had a takeaway - it was the first night in over 18 weeks that i felt completely \"normal\" - was so so good. i felt well, i didn't feel exhausted, i felt happy. drank a bit but feel fine this morning. just done a hilly walk - we live at the top of the biggest hill so it's good for fitness. i could breathe fine and just a bit of mucus in throat but nothing too bad. my throat feels so much better, nose and head doesn't feel like it is going to explode - maybe, just maybe, 18 is the magic number after all \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1ehope all ok with you gary and you are feeling well today and you've recharged your batteries.have a lovely day everyone. lx",
          "hi lulu i've still got some issues tight chest now and again the tension headaches as the gp called them have eased so has the earaches but both still there i feel the throat has improved a lot get it when i talk a lot tension on my neck and shoulder but doesn't hurt still getting little stabs in the back on the odd occasion but feel a lot better even with them symptoms i think you were right about 6 months it will probably all be better gary",
          "your doing well gary. keep going.",
          "improving jim and apart from the fainting i hope you are too keep doing the walking it will help you a lot i don't dread the thought of going to work at night so i know i'm getting somewhere this time in a couple of weeks you will feel a lot better too jim enjoy the rest of your day gary",
          "cheers gary.",
          "yep i noticed walking up hill i had small stabs of pain in upper back but nothing compared with before. also noticed after i exercise i get more mucus but i think that is because the lungs/throat are still healing and the mucus is produced to protect them so as they heal body will produce less. think the tight chest is where the mucus builds up sometimes over a few days and then gradually it is cleared - as mentioned before specialist said it is a big task for your body to rid itself of all the mucus - normally there is only minimal amount to lubricate throat/lungs etc. but after this virus because of inflammation the body just over produces it to protect itself. sort of makes sense to me but wish could just turn it off now - i am all mucused out!off to swat a few more wasps.lx",
          "yes that makes sense to me lulu time it is then hopefully a few more weeks just got to get on with it you be careful you don't get stung gary",
          "hi jim it's sounds like your really improving i'm so pleased it mentally helps you as well just take it easy when you need to that's what i do. i'm ok going back to 20hrs next week at work but mostly doing 9-4 and walking with a client so get fresh air still get tired but better in myself now which is a relief thanks for asking. \ud83d\ude4f",
          "that's good lulu hopefully a few more weeks and we're all be alot better, it really has been a horrible virus never felt like that in all my life especially the difficult breathing but at lest we're all here thank goodness. what a pain having wasp we had a mouse problem just before xmas and found one i think cat brought in just before he died as i was ill didn't see it til it was rotting lovely not \ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udc2d",
          "hi gary glad your feeling alot better as well its good getting back to work it takes your mind of it all and makes u feel a bit normal again. i'm not going for a 10 tomorrow still 9 1/2 for me as still have the fatigue at nights but getting better.",
          "you and me both susan been out tonight and had a good night but still feeling sugar but a lot better than a few weeks ago so maybe 9and a half would be good for me as well gary",
          "morning guys,what a miserable day it is here. the weather is horrid. constant rain since six o'clock and hadn't abated since.looks like it is going to rain all day.",
          "not much better here jim i'm off work today got a course tomorrow so nice and easy two days how you feeling today jim better than the weather i hope gary",
          "morning my pal, smashing news you've two easy days. i quiet like a course or three at work, makes the week go quickly and its easy.i'm okay. thank you gary.how are you?much as i've been fir the past few days, mucus on the chest and intermittent nose blocking.i really want to go for a walk but the rain is heavy enough to soak you through to the bone in 5 minutes flat.i can't believe i am bothered by it raining.52 years old and never been bothered by it before. i've turned nesh after all this. lol.",
          "it might ease off soon i know what you mean though once you get into a rhythm you want to keep it up jim i think like you we will have the mucus for a while yet i will stick with the sudafed for a few days and steam walking really helps as well just don't over do it keep improving that's the main thing gary",
          "totally agree gary.i've just got back from a walk. i thought bugger it, put on my pal's huge overcoat and did my new walk of 2,000 steps.just as i got back the rain stopped.you couldn't write our luck. lol.",
          "thanks gary! how are you today?",
          "hi res still getting there i just now have a bit of a tight chest slight tension round the head ears and neck and shoulder and heavy hands where the tingling has eased i'm doing most normal things and like everyone hoping for it all to go in the foreseeable future hopefully your there now gary",
          "yeah, the on and off mucous/tight chest is really annoying me at this point.i had a good road test for my recovery this weekend as my mum and her friend came down to visit and my god...i am way off normal.two days of dinners out, socialising and shopping and i was dead...absolutely flat on my back yesterday, couldn't move exhausted. actually don't know how i held it together for the 1 day visit. kinda depressing. i've been lucky in that i'm self employed and have been very much able to pace all my activity so this was the first time where i had to go along with other schedules and not my own pace and it's scary how little energy i have.still very much recovering today. going to paris this week and rather worried now about how much i can enjoy it. at least is with my partner and child so i can tell them if i get tired and rest.",
          "afternoon everyone!brilliant news gary and susan on 9.5 - such good progress going on now! i am going for 93/4!! i am not a 10 but not too far off now! still have some mucus but think more in back of throat and linked to the reflux issue, bit of tinnitus but breathing has really improved over the last week/10 days. i feel so much better in myself. am so happy about that and i was worried would be left with post virus fatigue at one point as was so lacking in energy and that would have been one of my worst nightmares to be exhausted forever more but that has really improved too and energy levels nearly back to normal.really glad you got your walk in jim - i was out just as it started raining but did nearly 4 miles - amazing that you are now on 2000 steps from where you were a few weeks ago. do you feel you are on the mend now?? i really hope so as i know you, like the rest of us, have been in such a bad place but from what you say you really seem to be improving now \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1ehope course goes well gary and glad it gives you a couple of easy work days.how is everyone else doing? be really interested to hear.lx",
          "sorry it's still lingering gary.i'm not fully myself yet either. energy levels are not what they were and the tight chest is on and off. so much improved though. hopefully get there in the end!",
          "i know what you mean res about the lingering it's worst than a magnet to shake off hopefully soon be there hope you can have a great time in france and it let's you enjoy your holiday gary",
          "hi resdefinitely that is the real test when you have to fit in with others - was the same the week we spent in suffolk - i really struggled and came back feeling worse than before i went. have another week booked in 3 weeks time so am really hoping able to enjoy it more as feel so much better than i did at beginning of july.the mucus is a big problem. i find the walking gets it moving and then can have a good cough up but it is gradually getting less and less so seems to be just a matter of time like all the other symptoms.have a great time in paris and as you say being able to pace yourself makes all the difference.lx",
          "thanks gary. hopefully \ud83e\udd1e",
          "hope you're able to enjoy your next trip lulu.yeah, i'm getting sick of the mucous. for me it descends without any obvious cause anytime/ anywhere, then disappears as mysteriously.on top of everything have a bout of cystitis \ud83d\ude44. fun times!",
          "hi lulu,hope your well and still improving. paris hey! that'll be lovely.i am sure i have improved, as i feel better in myself and a couple of friends have noticed, which is more tangible.regarding walking, i'm attempting to very gradually build up in the vain hope i don't relapse.safe trip.jim.",
          "hi everyone :)well done on those 9 1/2 and 3/4really gives hope to usi'm staying on 8 1/2 for now as last few days haven't been as good, tight chest, blocked nose, sore stomach and legs, a bit fed up with it after all of this time, but keeping positive, and i have been quite active. managed a walk between the showers and happy with that, chest seems to be clearing.trips away sound good res and lulu, have a great time",
          "poor you cystitis makes you feel really rough. agree there is little rhyme nor reason to the mucus and the varying amounts of it. mine has decreased a lot in last couple of weeks since been taking lansoprazole. lx",
          "hi jowhich week are you on roughly? gary i am are into our 18th - just wondering if you are a week or two behind as i have only really improved a lot over last couple of weeks. i always feel better when the weather cooler like today so will be interesting to see how feel at the end of week when it is expected to be 25 degrees again.i find the walking definitely helps clear chest - in fact i have been coughing quite a bit today after walk but my chest feels clear at last and the cough seems to be more in the throat which i don't mind so much.res is the lucky one off to paris and i'm off to suffolk again in 3 weeks time - hoping we have more sunshine than last time. am going with my youngest son so be great to spend some time with him.hope things pick up again for you soon jo, i know how frustrating it is - i had a big low a couple of weeks ago but things feel more stable now so pretty convinced it is just time. i really pray there are no more relapses to come \ud83d\ude4flx",
          "hi luluthanks, i'm the same as you and gary, 18 weeks. i felt a lot better last week and probably did too much. it was probably wearing the mask for over an hour that gave me the tight chest last week, and i think going down a fairly steep hill yesterday made my stomach sore. i think i've got inflammation there so i have to be careful what i do. i can manage slight uphill road walking but maybe the grass in the park was a bit bumpy, i don't know.anyway it does seem to be up and down still, i'll have to try not to do too much.suffolk sounds lovely, it'll be good to be with your son :)",
          "hi lulu and everyone,i'm on week 19 (does it even matter anymore what week it is??) going for a 9 as some days are really good and some days less. saturday felt pretty normal, people told me i looked a lot better (to be fair it was also the first time i bothered to wear make up so it might have just been that!) but then sunday got breathless and a bit achy and today have got pressured tingling down the side of my forehead and face on one side, also achy chest. did go eat out with the family today which was nice but think i'm not used to eating food that's a bit rich so tummy is a bit jumpy now. not sleeping great and feeling a bit edgy which is probably linked. feel like saturdays are always my good days and early in the week less good...weight is going up still so that's good, don't remember ever being so happy to be putting on weight \ud83d\ude05a lot of you sound like you're doing really well. we will get there!",
          "yes lows definitely seems linked to when you overdo it and i would struggle with a mask for over an hour - that is tough. hopefully you will pick up again and things will improve again quite quickly for you.just watched bbc news and the pilot who was in hospital in vietnam critically ill speaking about the horror of c19 - think it is good to get the message out there to stop people becoming complacent and let people know what can happen if you become infected. i know an extreme case but he is fairly young and must have passed his medical to be a pilot so presumably fit. lx",
          "no really don't think it does matter any more! i spose just gives some hope to those who are maybe a week or two behind and having a bad time that things seem to improve as the weeks progress.funny you mention which days you feel better, when we were in the thick of this and really sick i always felt really bad on a friday afternoon/eve and i think, for me, it was because i felt nervous that the gp was shut over the weekend! maybe it is the thought of a busy week stretching out ahead and the weekends are a bit more chilled for you - just a thought! or maybe you are more tired after the weekend if been out socialising more.good news about weight - i know i thoroughly enjoyed putting the stone i lost back on but now don't want to put on any more so it is a balancing act!hope your sleep improves soon as that always seems to make a huge difference to how we all cope and feel.take care, hope things settle down again soon.lx",
          "hi everyone, glad to hear some positive news, it gives us hope that we will all get better eventually. my chest is still tight and ears still poppy but tiredness is a lot better. managing to do more around the house and outside. think jim and i will be week 17 this week so hopefully things can only get better.",
          "hi jim all, you are funny jim made me laugh it could only happen to you. had a lovely walk over the hills and did some blackberry picking before it rained yesterday. meeting my daughter today for a walk along the seafront my favourite walk and looking in charity shops lol, eyes still playing up just wonder if it's the mask maybe it irritates my eyes or its the medication i'm on? hope your all feeling ok today.",
          "keep going steph your get there think i'm on week 18.",
          "hi res hope you feel better soon cystitis is horrible i had that in feb it makes u feel ill, i got antibiotics. enjoy paris lovely city \ud83d\udc95",
          "well done lulu 9 3/4 your def getting there i'm probably the same but still getting odd headache, cold like symptoms, buzzing ears, mucas very rare but still there at times and the fatigue. enjoy your time in suffolk with your son its great being able to spend time with the family now.",
          "thanks susan!yes, am pretty sure i got covid in paris in march so this is a kind of pilgrimage \ud83e\udd23.",
          "hi susanglad you are doing well and enjoying seeing daughter and those lovely beach walks! i still have tinnitus and feel like have a head cold on and off and a but of mucus so not completely better but nearly there just hope these last symptoms go quickly and then leave us alone to get on with life!enjoy your day.lx",
          "things will get better just these last symptoms hanging around. such good news tiredness is better i feel same. just wonder what causes the ear issues a few of us have must be linked to the mucus and throat problems would think.hope work going ok for you.lx",
          "hi steph,yes, it's week 17 as from thursday.hooe your improving.",
          "hi susan,sounds like you had a lovely day and another one today.fortunately, i didn't get wet just a tad moist. it was a big coat but didn't cover every bit. lol.had a couple of short walks so far today, just 1100 steps each time. i'm going to walk to the surgery and collect a prescription later and incorporate that in a longer stroll.have a great day.",
          "that's what i did jim to begin with i would start at 500 steps and just increased now i try and do at least 7000to 10000 steps a day now.",
          "just been over field with dog as well now going to try put a hint of rose hair colour on my hair lol",
          "that's brilliant 7,000 - 10,000 steps. fab",

          "ha! easily done gary when you are enjoying yourself - am sure you will pick up again just take it easy for a day or so. i managed to jinx it yesterday with my 93/4 score! what is it the minute you feel better and tell anyone the very next day you feel rubbish. woke up this morning with nose and sinus blocked and mucus at back of throat - it's so disappointing - how can you still have these symptoms after so long?? i really don't understand it! i did do a long walk yesterday so maybe am overdoing it i just don't know.glad work going well steph and nice to meet up with friends for lunch monday. enjoy your short week!! work is fine for me as only work thurs/fri and it is pretty quiet at the moment.so good you are feeling much better jim, i find both the nose blocking and mucus hard - it makes me feel ill and tired - didn't have it at all yesterday and felt so well compared with today.hope the hair colour turned out well susan!!take care everyone,lx",

          "hi lulu, everyoneglad you're feeling better, lulu, i am too, and i've managed to walk a bit further. i even ran for a few seconds to cross the road before lights changed!i hate these setbacks, but at least they're not as bad as before.yes it's worth being careful in the heat, i had a bad setback after walking a lot in the heat before. hope we haven't got any virus left inside us, but nobody really knows what's going on.good luck working nights, gary, hope you enjoy your time offthere's no stopping you now, jim, keep on walking!all the best everyone :)",
          "evening lulu yes your right my gp didn't have a clue told her about the headaches earaches even though seen the nurse about the wax tension on my neck and shoulder tight chest and pains in back she prescribed me fenbid forte gel said we will work on the back and shoulder pain first and i get to see a physio at 330 tomorrow not sure what he or she is going to do i'm feeling fine but when i get the tight chest it sets off the head tension i can manage it going to work soon but because we got covid rules job and finish i should be home by 4 or earlier know what you mean about the hot weather coming gary",
          "morning!hope work was ok gary and you've recovered from peronigate without any bad effects! been feeling really off last few days very sick and nauseous anyone else had any problems with lansoprazole? am wondering if should stop taking but dont want sore throat back as that has been better.hope everyone doing well enjoy the sunshinelx",
          "morning lulu,i haven't had any problems with lansoprazole but i've only taken it for two or three weeks.week 17 today.started feeling rough yesterday afternoon. i don't know why because i hadn't walked any further than the previous couple of days,sorry your feeling rough.fingers crossed we improve today.",

          "better luck than me jim i had a 330 with the physio today and went to the wrong surgery luckily enough he rang me and we went through everything and he's going to send me exercises that he feels will help me i'm not sure if they will work but i'll give them a go it's well hot today jim and we will suffer if not careful gary",
          "never mind gary at least you got the exercises.what bit of you are they for?beer weather tomorrow but i'm not partaking unfortunately.",
          "i went through the symptoms with the physio today and he feels they will help me with the stress on my shoulders neck and back which should ease the tension on my head and ears and resolve the issues with a few different exercises he will send me when he does them will see what they are when i receive them i will let you know jim bit hot for them today gary",
          "he has given me several exercises to help me the first one for the tension headaches i just get two fingers and massage my forehead for 5 minutes morning and afternoon and temple massage same given me utube videos to help got a few pages to follow so i have started trying them got to take it easy though going work soon so i will suss them out and crack on tomorrow gary",
          "hi lulu, sorry to hear you're feeling off. i've only been taking lansoprazole on and off and it's been ok. maybe cut down a little see what happens and the gaviscon. it's a lottery as to what will work or not!! hope today's been better for you. my staycation tan is coming along nicely lol xx",
          "i think i will cut down steph am taking two a day at moment maybe cut down to one and see how that goes and whether sore throat comes back. hope you are doing well and who needs to go to spain with weather like this?! the staycation tan helps a lot, everyone keeps telling me how well i look - even when i am feeling rubbish!am really surprised they were not wearing masks in the hospital jim - that is not very reassuring. good to have the 7 day ecg - are you worried about heart or is it precautionary?good to try the exercises gary and hopefully will help as does sound like some of the problem is tension in the shoulders and neck and then triggering headaches. i notice at yoga when doing relaxation teacher says relax your face and you don't realise how tense it is until you relax it!! have a lovely evening everyone.lx",
          "hi lulu, sorry my post was misleading. all the hospital staff wore masks. it was the people who were out and about.some members of the public in the hospital weren't wearing masks.also people were so blase walking close to other people, walking straight into lifts without seeing if anyone was inside.the ecg was for palpitations i've had during the virus. i hope everyone has a nice day in the sun.",
          "morning everyone well i have a week off to try to work out what is best ways to get relief with the exercises i'm still very dry first thing so i'm going to have to get more sos again or something else been drinking water at night still you mentioned the face lulu he has added a few face and neck exercises i've just ordered a yoga mat coming today to help me with the exercises it may ease the pressure and help shoulder is so weird there is no pain whatsoever it comes and goes gary",

          "hi gary and everyone,it is weird the coming and going of the pains you mentioned, feel the same with my own symptoms. reflux symptoms settled down on their own these last few days so no lump in throat and burning chest went but...there's always a but(!) have been having headaches on left side of head with tingling in face. it's like the symptoms do their rounds so if one thing clears it's on to the next. have been feeling very tired by about 6pm with eyes being red and sore like i haven't slept in days. also i'm starting to wonder if my eyesight has been affected i've never worn glasses but find i'm struggling to read small print which was never an issue. anyone else noticed anything like that?have a lovely day everyone but careful not to be out in the sun too much \u2600\ufe0f",
          "morning dane yes your right i've experienced what i called traffic lights eyes mine went well red and sometimes blurry not sure if it has anything to do with the tension maybe the physio has given me some exercises to do and i'm working on that this week off feeling a lot better but still can't shake off all the symptoms time i suppose enjoy the sun \u2600 and take care gary",
          "good you're feeling better overall, let us know how you get on with the exercises those sound interesting.specialist i spoke to wondered if i need a physiotherapist will know what he decided when i hear back which i'm not expecting will happen quickly.yes time the best healer...",
          "i will do dane he gave me some nice easy ones and put a utube video with them and i have ordered a yoga mat to help me with the tension headaches and earaches a simple two fingers on the forehead and circle like massages for a few minutes in the morning and evening helps don't know if that's just luck or not for the back go from the temple and do the same try them they may help gary",
          "hi jim/everyoneah ok yes there are plenty of stupid people around who are so impatient and won't wait to let you pass etc. i am very wary of lifts as i use a lot at work and has crossed my mind if someone has sneezed in that confined space and get out just before you get in you are walking straight into one of the most confined spaces we can enter and it is left full of germs. when i go back to the office i will be taking the stairs and that will definitely get me fit!good to wear the ecg for 7 days will give a clearer picture and will hopefully reassure you.i am feeling a bit better again but definitely feel its the mucus that makes me feel so unwell - it seems to move when i've exercised and then i need to cough it up. how's your mucus coming along jim?!it is a scorcher but seems to be blowing up for a storm here later - have stayed indoors today as just feel it won't help my breathing. hate having to think about everything so much - desperate to just feel \"normal\" again. my son suggested yesterday that i need to change my thinking and believing i am better - mind over matter that sort of thing - i am trying it today but the bottom line is i don't feel great! no-one to tell other than you guys everyone else is bored of it \ud83d\ude29lx",
          "hi guys,just an update for you all.on wednesday i was in a very black mood, shocking really. in the depths of my despair i took it upon myself to ring my local hospital complaints department, which i did. i regaled the whole story of my trip down covid boulevard finishing with the referral to the respiratory team on the 30th of june.the lady said she would look into it and someone would call me. i thought she might or might not do anything but at least i had tried. the following day a chap called me, a none clinician who said he would sort it. within an hour he called me back and told me a consultant would ring me this week.to his word a consultant called and said he would read my notes and call this morning, which he has done.in conclusion of a twenty minute none stop conversation he concluded i didn't need a ct scan, had improved since the height of the illness however slowly and that the mucus would eventually subside. his thoughts on full recovery is 18 months as our bodies have been through the toughest fight of our lives in the vast majority of cases.patience is the key with little but often exercise within current limits ensuring a good diet, all vitamins and minerals for the immune system. avoiding stress and most importantly avoiding infections.as you guys will know, i've a private consultation on monday, which i'm keeping and i'm going to have a ct scan too. i know it'll cost money but peace of mind is beyond expense.don't get burnt in this beautiful sunshine.jim.",
          "hi daneamazing the reflux has settled down now how long did you take medication for? have you stopped taking it now? i've had the lump in throat all week but seems a bit better today and never sure if it is mucus or not. if you google it is called a globus but doesn't say if it is just a sensation or actually something in throat. agree one thing gets better and another starts - surely it will give us a break soon? - you really start thinking you are imaginging all these symptoms! i think it has affected my eyesight i have noticed sometimes mine is very blurry and i can't focus properly but i know this can be caused by anxiety and stress and even though we might not feel anxious now our bodies have been stressed to the hilt and we have been on high alert for months so we probably are still showing signs of stress without even knowing it.take care,lx",
          "hi garygreat that you have a week off. the yoga mat will help a lot - even if you just relax and do the gentle exercises. also there are loads of yoga classes on youtube - yoga with adriene i find is one of the best - loads of routines to choose from and just checked there is one for complete beginners - then some short routines and some longer as you progress. take it easy though cos sometimes you feel you are not doing that much but it can be surprisingly more strenuous than people think - i always find that out when i get out of bed the next morning! i really believe yoga is a bit of a game changer and great to ease back into fitness.think you said you were meeting a mate tonight - so have a great time and enjoy the weekend (don't let him/her lead you astray!!).lx",
          "that's good news jim not the 18 months bit but finally someone listened and the ct scan it's true your health is more important than money gary",
          "too right gary. i'd give everything i own to go back to march and have my full health again.",
          "hi lulu thanks i will take it easy as i know i can still get fatigue and i will not be led astray i'm getting somewhere with the tension headaches and earaches but the stabbing pain in the lungs and back is annoying i have to be careful about the dehydration so dry today tonight fan will have to go back on the throat has been a nightmare for a few of us hopefully on the mend completely soon gary",
          "hi lulu,regarding the mucus, i stream three times a day for 15 minutes with salt water imbibed with menthol. can't say whether the menthol makes a difference but the steaming loosens the mucus.the acappella i bought from the jungle site helps too.to answer your question lulu i've still got mucus. my consultant said it will abate but it'll take a pong time. his estimate another four months to clear. eighteen months to full baseline health. crikey i know exactly what your thinking. me too.",
          "hey lulu,it's a bit odd really, i don't think it's gone completely but just realised i haven't taken gaviscon in about 4 days and lump in throat disappeared but today i can feel a slight sensation of it being there, i ate a lot of things i wouldn't normally eat very late last night so think it's that that's made me feel it again. i take 20mg famotidine every night before bed which is a very small dose and gaviscon as needed. think the reflux is a random symptom like the rest of them that comes and goes as i haven't changed anything in terms of medication and diet to make it disappear. i was told the lump feeling is inflammation that makes the food pipe a bit narrower so that it feels like something is blocking it not that there's anything actually stuck. hopefully reflux symptoms will ease with time like everything else.",
          "thanks jimjust read your earlier post. good news someone called you and listened at last. i hate to say it but i think he is right we are not going to fully recover over night - this is a slow burner but so long as all heading in right direction.i have been lazy with steaming but maybe need to go back to that.thanks for your help.lx",
          "thanks danei think the gaviscon makes me feel sick but am persevering. i am positive i had no reflux problems before so why now is beyond me! i was told to take lansoprazole first thing in morning and before evening meal - seems we are all told different things! makes more sense to me to take at night so may try that!enjoy the weekend!lx",
          "hi everyonei'm trying to keep cool today, had a short walk around the local shops this morning. my stomach is still sore and swollen, i think it must be inflammation and related to what i do. i'm going to try and cut down to one omeprazole a day and see if that makes any difference. i was reading about histamine intolerance and wondered if that's what's affecting me. but looking at foods to avoid, there won't be much left i can eat! maybe i'll cut down on a few things.18 months sounds a really long time :( hope notkeep cool everyone :)",
          "same with me lulu, never had issues with reflux.i was also told by gp to take lansoprazole in the morning but ditched it after 6 days when didn't see any difference. lanzoprazole your supposed to take before food as opposed to after. famotidine is a different drug altogether and its advised to take at night before bed but can also be taken 1 hour before food which i tried but wasn't as effective for me. i've taken this on my own it wasn't advised by anyone. it's all guesswork",
          "that must be so uncomfortable jo. you could try an elimination diet just cutting out one food at a time to see if it helps though you need patience with that. i also read up on histamine sensitivity when i was wondering why i was having stomach issues also since the virus i'm apparently allergic to papaya it made my lips itch for hours could be we have developed sensitivity to a bunch of things.",
          "thanks dane that's interesting that you have developed an allergy since having the virus. i thought i was being really healthy with my porridge full of nuts and fruit, but it seems nuts and most of the fruit is high histamine. it's definitely worth finding out if there's anything affecting my symptoms",
          "uggghhhh i finally thought things were turning around for me only to be sorely disappointed yet again. earlier this week i had a d-dimer test which is supposed to indicate the possibility of blood clots and which i tested positive for. i thought that there was finally something quantifiable that would corroborate my story to my pcp. he did order an ultrasound of my legs to check for dvt, but when that turned out negative, he's apparently done following this lead. when i asked for further testing, like chest scans to check for pe and the like since i'm still feeling symptoms in my chest, he told me to just go to the er if i still feel bad, which i imagine is as close to f*** off in doctor speak as you can get. of course, this is all after he told me to see a psychiatrist. so, so frustrating. i'm wondering if i should take this d-dimer test right to a vascular surgeon or the like, or if they would also dismiss me out of hand.",
          "morning lulu and everyone something is not right i was told by the doctor if you remember when i went to the hospital to take omeprazole but he was telling me that i was suffering from anxiety and stress because of everything that had happened that's what he diagnosed so why the omeprazole did they tell you what reason because if you remember back i was taking gaviscon in the morning and i told him that and he told me not to take gaviscon i took all of the omeprazole so it must have been about a month ago gary",
          "morning joanne i hope you are feeling better today i was told by the doctor at the hospital to take omeprazole because at the time i was taking gaviscon in the morning because i kept feeling something coming up he told me that i was suffering from anxiety and stress because i was getting what i thought was migraines and earache tingling hands and legs i was told they are tension headaches and earaches so not sure why they prescribed the omeprazole the tension headaches and earaches have eased but not gone for some reason i now have tension on my shoulders and neck as well weird something is not right oh well perhaps the doctors know best just got my yoga mat starting exercises see if they can help me gary",
          "hi garythat sounds a bit confusing. i was given omeprazole 2 months ago as i had indigestion, churning stomach and stomach acid. do you think you were given it for the stomach acid affecting your throat? the doctor's given me a repeat prescription for 2 a day, i tried to cut down to 1 before but the indigestion came back. i'm trying again to see what happens. my stomach is still a bit swollen so i'm going to be careful what i do.i think there's so little doctors can give us, they're trying everything, and a lot of people seem to have reflux issues with the virushave fun with yoga mat! i'm sure exercises will help with everything. i must do more yoga!",
          "morning garyhave fun on the yoga mat! if you get the right exercises will def help the tension in shoulders and neck - reminds me i need to do my routine it is easy to get lazy!i agree with jo that the omeprazole or lansoprazole in my case is prescribed for the sore throat and mucus as this is caused by silent reflux (basically you don't know you have reflux as don't get indigestion) my specialist also told me that the silent reflux is made a lot worse by anxiety so that is probably why you were dished out some. also as jo said i think it is just trial and error to see what helps with which symptoms and it has helped my sore throat but am not convinced i have any sort of reflux but who knows?? pretty certain i didn't before my dice with c19 as had no symptoms whatsoever - no sore throat, no mucus so think it is yet another symptom of the virus which is responding to treatment with these drugs. i know your throat is a lot better now so that is good news. mine comes and goes but today roof of mouth feels inflamed - i might go crazy as it is saturday and treat myself to a flarin \ud83d\ude02off for a picnic - will be nice to sit in a different field \ud83e\udd74lx",
          "thanks for the explanation lulu really strange but i suppose they know better than us i had to try the flarin again too powerful headache came back they have eased and i'm hoping the exercise will help i'm like you though have to push myself to do them enjoy your picnic gary",
          "hi gary,when i used to body build i suffered with numerous shoulder injuries, which always cause neck aches and pains.my physio at the time gave me a pair of back balls. they are two silicone balls that are moulded together.you use them by laying on them with a ball wither side of your spine.they will come with instructions and are around a tenner.",
          "hi dane and everyone. dane, i had to stop posting on here last weekend as my eyes were suddenly terrible - i couldn't focus at close range at all and i was getting bad headaches. i put it down to the fact that i might need new glasses so i have arranged for an eye test this coming week. i had to stop looking at my phone etc. hence me disappearing again.( apologies lulu, i never answered your post a week ago.) the eye symptoms and headache have subsided at last and my eyes can see again at close range which is puzzling to me. today is the first day i've checked the forum in a week and i see your post mentioning the eye problem. it seems like too much of a coincidence to me. i also get tired in evenings between 6 and 8 and the lump in the throat makes an appearance although gaviscon seems to relieve it most of the time. despite the headaches, in terms of breathing and coughing i have had 10 days of being almost totally normal. it has been brilliant! unfortunately, i made the mistake of telling a couple of family members that i'm breathing better and guess what - tight chest is back today \u2639\ufe0f unbelievable. why does it happen every time i try to give people positive news?i guess i'll have to hope it's temporary. anyway i hope you're having a good day today dane and everyone else. the sun is shining here in west sussex and the smell of bbqs is wafting across the fields. oh for a beer! hugs to all. stuart",
          "hi joanne yes i suppose like lulu said it must be i've finished the course now when i first started with the omeprazole he told me take 2 the first 3,days then down to one yep trial and error i've done a few exercises and a few more tomorrow and so on enjoy the sun \u2600 gary",
          "hi stuartgreat that you have updated us and to hear you have been doing well! it is just crazy that every time you mention to anyone you are feeling a lot better it comes back to bite you - i am the same whether it is on here or to family/friends. we went out last saturday night to friends had a great evening said to my friend sunday it's the best i've felt since march, she said you seemed like your old self, i posted the good news on here on monday and increased my wellness score to 93/4 and as i hit \"post reply\" i literally took a turn for the worse!! couldn't stop coughing monday night and tuesday and felt full of mucus - unbelievable! i definitely think the eye sight thing is linked but reckon it might be made worse by stress and anxiety and there has been plenty of that going on! i am on the gaviscon advance just picked up a new bottle and got the aniseed by mistake, it is even more disgusting than the peppermint! i am not sure whether taking it makes any difference to the lump in throat, i just associate it with being pregnant when i literally used to swig it out of the bottle in the middle of the night! will monitor it more carefully to see if it does actually help. i popped out yesterday afternoon after staying in all day as i was working and really felt like i couldn't breathe due to the heat so maybe your tight chest is related to the weather as still very muggy here today - i hate all this up and down, trying to work out why you feel like this or why you feel like that and if you do this it makes you feel worse - just having to get on with it not knowing what each day will bring - everyone i know just assumes i am better now as no longer bother to ask so i spose just hope for the best that things will improve albeit very slowly!lx",
          "hey lulu, great to hear from you. yes it's crazy the ups and downs - and the unpredictability makes it difficult to make any plans with confidence too. it has been great feeling mostly fit these last days despite the eye problems, and it's such a relief to not be constantly self examining so i'm a bit disappointed to be having the chest 'feeling' again. i really thought i'd got it beat. jim's news about 18 month recovery isn't something i want to even contemplate. \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude13the eye problem thing is weird, but it has prompted me to get them tested as they are overdue a trip to the optician. funny you mentioned the gaviscon. i actually like the aniseed version and mistakenly bought peppermint the other day so i was a bit disappointed! \ud83d\ude02i didn't know about different flavours. i was getting breathless symptoms and the lumpy throat whenever i ate and they have lessened a lot since the administering of gaviscon! so whether it's coincidence - no idea, but i'm going to continue. you might be right about the hot weather although it has helped me in the past. i'm going to hope it's a temporary blip and that we'll be back to normal soon. as for telling people positive news about health, well its like someone is having a big joke at our expense. \"feel better do you!? bwahhahaha - i'll soon stop that!\" looks like it's best to maintain silence on the matter. anyhow lulu, have a good rest of the day and get 100% well soon.",
          "ha! maybe i'll be an aniseed convert after a day or two! remind me stuart was it you who had the x-ray which showed a lump of mucus in lung, seem it was the same time as i had my first xray? are you still having any mucus issues? also did you ever take lansoprazole or any of the reflux drugs?yep it's radio silence from me on how i'm feeling - every time i report good progress i am immediately doomed \ud83d\ude02thanks.lx",
          "hi lulu, yes it was me. i had an atelectasis on my lung which was either caused by a mucus blockage or a collapsed area. thankfully it was clear when xrayed two months later. it was pretty worrying but in a way i'm glad of it as it proved to the doctors that i wasn't just having an anxiety attack!! (\ud83d\ude44) the mucus is mostly throat and nasal i think these days but one never knows by tomorrow. as for lanzoprazole i was never prescribed any recently s i stopped bothering with my doc, but i had some from a previous problem months ago. i took two a few weeks back and felt nauseous so i stopped. no idea if that was a wise move or not. i have some famotidine that was sent to me from spain but i haven't used it yet. i'm basically making it up as i go \ud83d\ude02thanks for asking, take care lulu. stuart",
          "wow that must have been awful and so worrying for you i do remember those days well, in fact will never forget them. it makes me angry when the docs label anything they don't know how to deal with as being caused by anxiety. i am not an anxious person normally but have to say my anxiety went off the scale when i realised i had c-19 and it most definitely wasn't mild flu like symptoms!i'm same the mucus mostly throat and nasal - sometimes feel like head is about to explode. have never suffered with sinus or anything respiratory in past - in fact the girls i work with used to laugh at the fact they'd never ever seen me blow my nose! i am taking lansoprazole twice a day and gaviscon after every meal with a few mucodyne tablets thrown in the mix!me too ..am just winging it, what choice do we have?! but it does help to have you guys as we can share all the information we have struggled to obtain - shame some gov medical boff doesn't have a read of all these posts - it make give them a better understanding of what is really going on with this illness and the recovery time.keep in touch, let us know when you're lagging and we'll move on to the next page \ud83e\udd23",

          "hi dane, i'm glad you had a good day. must be great to be doing normal stuff and coping with it. well done. yes the eye thing is very strange as i couldn't focus on anything on my phone and i felt like my vision had really gone downhill combined with stressful headaches. and yet it's fine now. i'm seeing an optician on thursday as they need checking anyway. how long have you had the symptoms? have a good evening.",
          "morning stuart, everyone i've had eye issues from the first few weeks of the virus but the symptoms have changed over the weeks.noticed the focus problem a few weeks back and reading issue this past week.one of those mysteries...wishing all a lovely, relaxing sunday and enjoy the sunshine.",

          "that's really good news jim because when i went to the hospital when i was told i had anxiety and stress i was told to get back to what you normally do so even though i haven't got back to a proper routine yet i had a couple of pints yesterday but drunk water as well before i went to sleep still getting dry mouth all night i am keeping the dehydration at bay don't fancy that again enjoy the sun \u2600 and your day jim will take in a couple more pints myself later as no work tomorrow gary gotta keep remembering the water as well though",

          "hi everyone!sounds like things improving jim - a couple of beers sounds very enjoyable! hope the exercises will help gary and the chest tension eases up - why do these symptoms just keep recurring? - i just don't understand it. i have been shopping today with a friend and had a really nice time even wearing a face mask - we did get used to it. plenty of hair sanitiser and used apple pay so no having to punch in pins on card reader if over 45 pounds- where there's a will there's a way!well today's symptoms are (yawn \ud83e\udd71) pain in my right lung (that was the side that the ct scan showed small patch of damage) it feels as if i have mucus trapped in it and have general aches and pains in shoulders and upper back. no sore throat today (that was yesterday's treat) together with an inflamed tongue which has magically disappeared today! i often think if someone chased me would i be able to run away (which i definitely could prior to march) and the answer is most definitely not - that makes me sad \ud83d\ude22 on the other hand the likelihood of someone chasing me is unlikely (!!) but it does made me realise i am still far from right.my friend i went shopping with is a work colleague and thinks she probably had it as 5 of us all sat together and were all ill around same time to varying degrees. she lost her sense of taste and smell and had bad sore throat same time as me and she was complaining today that her eyesight is now terrible but hadn't linked it to c19 but seems quite a coincidence from what others are saying.have a nice day everyone!lx",

          "ah sounds like you've had a nice day too jo. you must miss your son and it is a worry i saw about the lockdown - aus and nz are going in hard. one of the guys i work with is going to nz next week and has to do two weeks quarantine in a hotel of the gov choice - you get put on a bus and taken to hotel could be 1* or 5* no choice and have to stay in room with food delivered for 14 days - that would be tough. my son is now in ny - he was in la but things got really bad so he jumped on a flight as ny now doing better - he has said he may come back to london in a couple of weeks but the us will not let him return direct from uk so will have to go back via canada and quarantine there for 2 weeks - when i asked why he was coming over now he laughed and said \"ermm..to see you\" - aww.. but then i was thinking .. i won't want to see you for well over a week after you arrive so factor that in - it's all so tough!good luck with working tomorrow and yes definitely need to be more organised these days - i don't think any of us would believe where we are now - walking round shops with everyone masked made me feel sad and think how on earth has this happened.lx",
          "thanks luluyes, i find shopping really strange too, wearing masks. i've even tried to smile at people with my mask on, like when a car stops to let you cross the road. and i'm not very observant in the shops where to queue etc, i really have to concentrate.my son wants to come back for a visit but he would probably have to quarantine here and wouldn't be allowed back as the borders are closed. yes, really miss him, but we have to make do with facetime for now.that would be lovely if your son came to visit, but he'd have to come for a while to allow for quarantine x",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've made it to my 59th birthday today i've been dry all night drinking plenty of water my tension has eased right down on my head and ears got a bit in the neck and nose and shoulder the back has eased as well still niggling now and again i'm hoping only a few more weeks left i did have a few pints last night and no problems with it so far going to be with the girls today my eldest cooking me dinner looking like a sunny one enjoy whatever you are up to and i hope your symptoms are easing up gary",
          "happy birthday gary!!!really hope you have a wonderful day.i know what you'll be wishing for when you blow out your candles.",
          "happy birthday garyenjoy your day :)",
          "oh happy birthday gary! have a very lovely day!20 weeks today for me and going up to a 9 1/2.",
          "aww.... happy happy birthday to you gary!! have a wonderful day with your girls. as jim says make that wish when you blow the candles out and if you can add one in for the rest of us that would be great!!hope you have a peaceful day and have fun.lxx (two kisses from me as it's your birthday \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02)",
          "brilliant dane, so happy for you that you have improved it's such positive news! i was 93/4 last week not had a great week but will stick with that as can't face going backwards! think maybe as you get better expectations get higher - i just feel very cloggy in lungs, throat and nose - i feel like i need to be hoovered out if that makes sense!anyway have a great day and hopefully august will be the month we all finally feel better.lx",
          "how you feeling jim? still doing ok? give us a round up when you get time of how things progressing for you and if you could give me a mucus update that would be great as i am still struggling!lx",
          "morning lulu,feeling the same as last week lulu, so better than i have been. i did have a dip between wednesday to friday though. i didn't get chance to steam yesterday evening, so i'm suffering with more mucus than normal today.i've done my usual 2k steps, steamed and breathing exercises but can still feel it on my chest. i've got some up but not much. boo.today is the day the private consultant is calling me, so i'll be able to update on his idea's etc.if you've any questions feel free to ask me and i'll add them onto my list.",
          "hear that lulu, you're only 1/4 away from being 100% so you're going to watch those niggling symptoms until they completely go. but boy, you've come a loooong way, we all have and it helps to remember that to keep going forward. you'll get there x",
          "thanks jim hope not too late as been out. my questions are all mucus related really how long is the mucus produced for, when will it end why is it worse some days than others - does exercise make it worse or better, should you stretch self on exercise. when will we all be better?!am sure all things you will ask anyway.thanks so much.lx",
          "ah thanks dane, some days easier than others and the 93/4 might have been a bit optimistic and reckon will be a while before 100% but as you say we have all come a looong looong way. thanks for the encouragement, it is what we all need to stay positive.lx",
          "you've not missed the boat lulu.all your questions are added to my list and i'll update after we've spoken.the appointment is at 17:45, so i'll post tonight.",
          "brilliant thanks jim, hope he gives you some answers.lx",
          "hi everyone weather's lovely again. happy birthday gary hope you're enjoying your special day !! i've had a lovely day catching up with friends and at times forgot that i'm still not 100% but being out and not worrying too much about what if's was good. just this final phase to get over and we'll all be there.",
          "hi stephso pleased you had a lovely day with friends and yes it is such a relief not to be thinking about how you feel for a few hours and actually enjoying yourself. i definitely find if i can keep busy it helps a lot but have to be careful not to over do it - bit of a balancing act really! take care,lx",
          "hi lulu,i asked all the questions, however he wouldn't be drawn giving answers without sight of a ct scan, which will be this week.sorry.",
          "ah that's fair enough - i suppose he has to see what has gone on from the scan first.thanks anyway for asking jim.lx",
          "hi lulu, yes defo agree keeping busy helps. i felt really tired after but think it could have been the afternoon tipple. how's your nausea been? i've not been taking any meds recently just want to give myself a break.",
          "nausea seems to have gone steph - maybe it was not related - who knows?! have felt a lot of mucus on chest last few days and sore throat back this eve! i didn't walk much over weekend and think mucus settles in lungs so did a 3 mile walk today and feels a bit clearer tonight - i've definitely been a bit up and down over last week or so but no idea why. just hoping will feel well before 17th when go away for a week. i think the more you get back to normal you do feel tired in the evenings but for me it feels different to that awful exhaustion in the early days - i remember by 6.00 p.m. i was shattered every night and could hardly move to make dinner. anyway at least we are getting back to some sort of normality having an afternoon tipple! i have prosecco on the green tuesday tomorrow that is still an ongoing weekly event \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf7elx",
          "morning everyone i had a movie day with the girls my girls have weird taste watched a scary film quiet place scared me more than them and a comedy worlds end i think it was called chilled with a few pints last night not feeling like doing anything today thanks for the birthday wishes everyone best present would be for the little sugar to do one i'm so glad that the tension headaches and earaches have eased up can feel them but not like before hoping dry mouth will get better soon my hands and legs feel tired today enjoy prosecco \ud83e\udd42 today lulu think like you jim im going to have to start steaming again feeling the mucus first thing gary",
          "hi gary,sounds as though you had a lovely birthday my pal.i spoke to the consultant last night who said mucodyne or like medicines will not harm us and if they help take them. he stressed excess mucus had to come up.i told him my regime of a walk, steam then breathing exercises and he said that you can't do anymore than that.its a pain.",
          "morning jim yes i think he is right it is a pain and a battle everyday i've just steamed not feeling a walk today but will battle on legs and arms feel tired how's your walking going hope you're feeling better today gary",
          "gary,take it steady today pal, as he said to definitely not to over do it or try to push through fatigue.i feel very much as last week pal. mucus, intermittent nasal blockage and tired if i do too much, which isn't a lot. i did complete three walks yesterday total of 5k steps, which is an improvement.slow but its there.",
          "think you may be right if we push through the fatigue it comes back to bite us jim i'm just going to do some chores and take it easy today get back to walking tomorrow i will have to order some more medication for the mucus have a good day gary",
          "rest day for me too, gary, did couple of hours work yesterday, with lift to get there, and totally done in. i've also got a lot of congestion. may have a little walk later if i've got the energy.bit late with my weekly score but going up to 8 3/4 as i managed to work, and that was fine, but the whole experience has left me exhausted. i guess i've got quite a way to go for that \"normal\"have a good day everyone :)",
          "hi joanne yes i know what you mean it takes it out of us if we push it and i got totally shattered when i went back to work even though i am not working this week tired and blocked chest as well tension is easing so i will stay on 9 and a half i think i was last time can't remember this thing makes me forget as well gary",
          "hi jo and everyonegood that you did some work yesterday jo and that is definitely progress even though it wiped you out - i have been working four weeks now and still feel tired at end of day and am not having to go anywhere as am wfh but it does get easier and mentally i think good to be back doing something. glad your score has gone up - think it is hard to score now as we all seem to have plateaued where we are feeling overall much better but still far from right. last few days felt really chesty and mucus in throat and lungs - worked it out i hadn't done a proper walk for around 4 days as just been generally running around so went out for a hilly walk late afternoon yesterday and it has made a difference so think for me the walking is an important part of recovery - i think if you do too much it sets you back but if you don't do enough the congestion settles in - hard to get the right balance. i've just done 4 hilly miles and feel ok at moment but as we all know that can change by this eve. met an acquaintance on walk whose son is a respiratory doctor at whipps x hospital east london who told me they have had no c19 admissions for 3 weeks but have still got patients recovering on the ward. she told me i must have pneumonia vaccine in autumn as definitely will be vulnerable after this but have to say prior to this i never had any vaccines was always a bit wary of them but maybe i need to rethink that.gp phoning this afternoon as i need another phased return to work sickness note - will ask him all the usual questions and see if i can find anything else out which might help us. glad you enjoyed your birthday gary and jim sounds like you are doing well upping the steps - that's a big jump from your 2k so hopefully things are improving.enjoy the sunshine everyone.lx",
          "gosh 4 weeks back at work, that's good lulu, yes i suppose the tiredness will linger for a while. i'm hoping to continue with mondays, and can maybe do more at some point.i need to walk too. it's weird, even though i'm really tired today, i was able to do a half hour flattish walk, but that was enough, i couldn't have gone further. yes maybe have to think about vaccinations this year, i work with children, so i don't want to be catching anything this winter, especially, as you say we'll be vulnerable now. x",
          "i'm lucky too that i only work thurs/fri and am on phased return so am only doing 10.00>16.00 so not really back at work in the true sense - not like gary having to do nights, that must be tough especially when not fully recovered.i think you have to listen to your body with the walking - i have overdone it so many times. my friend i walk with really pushes it as it is her daily exercise so i don't want to hold her back but know it is sometimes too much for me - it is the long steep hills which are killers.spoke to gp - nice but useless - basically knew nothing about anything c19 related and just kept saying check with your specialists - gps must love it when you go privately as you are no longer their responsibility! only good thing he extended the phased return to work note! i did say in a slightly sarcastic tone \"do i take it you haven't seen many covid patients\" he replied \"ive seen a few and they are taking weeks/months to recover but so long as you are progressing that is all we can hope for\" - great!!hope the tiredness is better tomorrow .lx",
          "i think i'm going to try a walk, feeling quite tight in chest today. been doing so much socialising either for myself or for the kids that not had time to go for a walk in a while. also when i rush around from one thing to the next it gets too much very quickly. i just can't rush full stop. also the walk gives much needed time out and space to relax and i really need that.i also normally don't do flu vaccines but think i will this year.",
          "yes i really missed my walk yesterday, i'm used to going most days now, and like you, dane, i find it relaxing. i can't rush either, i think everything is working much slower, including my brain :)",
          "yeh same especially from 6pm onwards!",
          "hi all wouldn't let me in . just been reading everyone messages still seems we all getting symptoms still i'm ok been working felt unwell yesterday afternoon but been really busy out shopping,went out for lunch friday for the first time and working it feels like you have a start of a cold but ok today just fatigue. i give myself 9 1/2 again this week due to these setbacks. glad your slowly recovering jim \ud83d\ude01 happy belated birthday gary.",
          "hi susanhad been wondering how you were getting on. the feeling that you are getting a head cold is very strange i get this every few days and then it goes away. good that you have been busy and out and about - if only we didn't keep getting these setbacks we would all be over the line - i just find it so frustrating not knowing how each day is going to be. i have had a much better day today - no idea why other than the walking yesterday and again today - definitely think it helps me keep the mucus from settling. i am constantly looking at what i have done differently from day to day but can't find any reason for the setbacks. i was desperate last night so didn't eat any chocolate as ent guy told me to cut out chocolate to help the reflux which i hadn't!!- i'm really hoping that isn't why i feel better today as not sure can live without a couple of pieces of chocolate in the evening! he also told me to cut out wine and tomatoes - all my favourite things - why couldn't it be brocolli , spinach and carrots \ud83d\ude02take care, enjoy your walks.lx",
          "lulu,in the words of my consultant, walking is the bodies physiotherapy.he said don't tire yourself out because it puts you back.",
          "hi lulu glad it's not just me that feels like that i do think it's when we over do things. works been ok i've been out walking with a couple clients each day to get my walking in also been with my daughter and grandson alot i'm in her bubble as i have rorie for her when she's working from sept i've missed him he keeps me going and my other grandchildren. glad youve been going out etc it does help us mentally. in the next couple weeks we're going to have the new tests that show in 9mins i think it's 9 mind at our works weekly for staff and monthly for clients unless they show symptoms it tell covid or flu symptoms.",
          "i agree, think it makes a big difference jim as really notice the days i don't have the time to do a \"proper\" walk so i am going to have to factor it into my day. i'm pretty sure i overdo it so am going to try really hard not to!hope you are doing well and thanks for the advice.lx",
          "lovely that you can see your daughter and grandson regularly - you definitely need to be fit by september then!! i read about the tests - that will be reassuring for you. i notice you do not hear much about the antibody tests these days - presumably as they have decided they are not accurate enough.hope you get some beach walks in this week as such beautiful weather - although friday looks too hot and i get worried as the extreme heat affects my breathing - well it did last week but i will be working so can stay indoors!take care,lx",
          "morning guys,woken up feeling tired today but had my walk, steamed and exercises.feel bunged up but the sun has finally started to shine through and the wind is dying down.hope everyone has good day.",
          "same here, jim, really blocked up today. i spent ages clearing it last night and now it's back again. what a pain!!good luck, enjoy your day",
          "you too jo.i've given up trying to clear it this morning.",
          "morning everyone same as me i'm afraid i'm blocked up as well feel shattered and haven't done anything really bloody nightmare now trying to work out how to get through it all the time has anyone tried mullein oil for the mucus gary",
          "no not tried that gary, sorry.",
          "hi jim i've ordered some because i have tried the walking steaming and the salt water i know we have it for a while but what i have also noticed is when my chest goes tight the tension does as well on my head it's eased a lot so has the tingling but it's not gone yet gary",
          "hello dane and everyone. apologies for answering you so many days late, my eyes became very strained again and have given me lots of headaches, so i've not felt very well when needing to concentrate on reading or... anything for that matter, so i have had to stop again. i have my eye test tomorrow so we'll see how badly they have degraded. maybe you should consider getting yours looked at dane. i did a walk on sunday where i continued walking instead of taking my usual rest on a bench after 20 minutes. i suppose i walked for 35 minutes without stopping and i now realise after reading what jim's consultant said, that i did too much as i had sharp jabbing pains in my chest afterwards and i haven't been too good since. whether that has contributed to my eye problems too i just don't know.anyway, i'll keep this short as it's playing havoc with my headache. apologies if i don't answer anyone for a while. please get better everyone. hugs to all and happy belated birthday gary!! stuart",
          "sorry to hear that stuart, don't worry about replying you concentrate on getting yourself better. it's very unpleasant to have headaches and difficulty with eyes. if you have energy would be interesting to know how the eye check goes, but no pressure to report back.my eyes are now mainly sore and can get very teary even in the middle of the night i sometimes have to get up to dry them. the walking is a delicate balance for all of us i think.wish you better stuart.",
          "thanks stuart and as dane said no need to apologise and we all know what you are going through if you get a chance look up you tube for exercises to help you with the headaches my physio has helped me with them i'm still getting them but only slightly and i think it's linked to the tight chest you can put two fingers on your forehead and massage gently for a few minutes then for the back go from the temple massage gently twice a day i've just got some mullein oil for the mucus hoping it eases it gary",
          "how is everyone? i felt pretty good again beginning of this week after feeling a bit rubbish last week but totally overdid it yesterday. did yoga, met a friend in afternoon, then another friend in evening and haven't slept well for two nights so feeling wiped out and my lungs and throat feel like full of cotton wool. finding it hard to stay positive when as soon as you start leading a \"normal\" life the symptoms are still there. also the constant mucus and tinnitus is really wearing.there was an article in the telegraph today saying 500,000 people are feeling the effects of \"long covid\" said people were being told by gps that they either had anxiety or me. sounds like some people much worse than us presumably people who have been in icu. can't read the whole article as you need to subscribe.at least people are now waking up to all the ongoing issues but seems gps reluctant to send you to post covid hubs etc. if you do not have a positive test - what an absolute farce as we mostly know testing was not available unless you were hospitalised.anyway, hope someone has some good news to report - i def need cheering up! have been working today so at least a bit of a distraction.lx",
          "hi lulusorry you've been feeling rough, it's so hard to get the balance right. i'm trying not to do too much at the moment, i seem to get tired easily so it's hard to plan things. i feel ok, but not doing a lot. i've tried some online yoga, but even half an hour was a bit much. also some of the stretches feel too much for my chest and stomach. so i just watched the video!that's good that people are becoming more aware of long term affects, just wish doctors would show more interest in us even if they can't help us, at least refer us to someone who can. they should know more about the virus by now.hope tomorrow is a better day for you, lulu, and you soon get back to where you were x",
          "hi lulu,a similar article is on the daily mail website.there was also an article on 111, and their vast failings.the whole job has been a culster f#*k from start to finish.my gp called me today and suggested i came off all medication to find out whether any of it was doing anything. valid point she has to be fair because other than the mucodyne i don't think anything else is.oh good news i've my ct scan tomorrow at 8:45am and a subsequent follow up on the 17th.",
          "ah thanks jo, yes it is so hard to plan anything. i think also the not sleeping well doesn't help. i knew last night that i was heading for a crash and was right! i do worry a lot as to what condition my lungs are - the specialist said overall pretty good just the right lung with small bit of damage but just feel so congested and it seems to move between lungs, throat and head - can't begin to imagine what people must feel like who were worse affected.i think you are being sensible taking it easy, i am going to try and do the same!take care, lx",
          "hi jimi have thought of doing the same with the meds - do you think the mucodyne helps? ive been on it so long i've no idea. what else do you take which is on prescription?how you feeling generally? sorry lots of questions!that is good news about ct scan, assume that is privately? will be good to find out at least what is going on. how do your lungs feel? lx",
          "hi lulu,i take lansoprazole 30mg for acid reflux, which i don't think i need.mucodyne substitute, which does thin my mucus. however, i can't tell whether its from lungs, throat or both!salbutamol inhaler, which increases my peak flow by 30-40.oh and a whole array of vitamins and minerals.for me, the mucodyne, a walk, steam for 15 minutes then breathing exercises is about as good as i can do clearing my chest without a physio showing me how to do it properly but they aren't seeing anyone because of covid.lulu, like all of us, i have a batch of good days and a bad day follows. i've noticed the more i over do things the longer it takes to recoup my energy.today i've done nearly 6k steps, so i'm going in the right direction but it is 18 weeks today.i've found out to my expense too many times that over doing it really sets me back. i'm of a mind now, a gradual increase and see how it goes. it's a learning curve as no one knows anything about the virus nor its consequences health wise especially in the long term.why don't you see your chest consultant and have another ct scan and have him compare the results. that would be worth doing especially for peace of mind.",
          "hi lulu and everyone, i too have been feeling very tight in chest and i've been reading the mail's article today and someone described it as a concrete slab on chest and that's exactly how mine feels. my breathing's not great either!! i can feel the mucus in my chest throat but it's not coming up. also getting the internal shakes still when will it end.....sorry to post doom and gloom. like you say lulu it's hard to stay positive when you feel like you've got cotton wool inside lol. good luck for tomorrow jim and glad you're not just settling for gp's blub we need answers as we've been suffering for soooo long. hope some are feeling better than us. xx",
          "hi steph,i was given the knock back for a scan via the nhs but had already put wheels in motion to go privately.the nhs consultant said everything would settle in a few months. umm, been fobbed off there. no need for a scan when i asked for one.we'll see when i've the scan results.my gp and her colleagues have all said we'll recover from the fatigue in time but the symptoms, who knows.being positive, we must be getting better however slowly. we must.",
          "yep think i've just been overdoing it but just seems ridiculous after all this time that you can't lead a normal life. i think they are loathe to carry out another ct scan so soon gp told me radiation is equivalent to 400 x-rays (not sure if that is true!) but i have a follow up early september and will ask him then.great progress on the steps jim and agree i just don't know where mucus is from but assume some is in the lungs as feel so woolly.hope all goes well tomorrow.lx",
          "me too steph - it's just so depressing and my gp went down the anxiety road on tuesday - really p****d me off. these are physical symptoms there is no doubt about it and the internal vibration i always notice in bed at night. i think it is the mucus that is causing most of the problems. i have done much shorter walk today so will see if that helps!just heard from my niece who lives in london has a really high temperature and problems with sore eyes she has a test tomorrow am praying she hasn't got it. take care steph, really hope we pick up again tomorrow.lx",
          "yes i think it's so easy for the docs to brush it off as anxiety making us doubt our symptoms but we all know it's something we've never experienced before !! yes agree it's probs mucus causing the probs but docs should be treating us for that. like jim said it's all been a farce from start to finish 111 etc sorry to hear about your niece lulu, hopefully she'll feel better soon xx",
          "morning everyone right guys i'm not going to beat around the bush you know that the gp down the hospital said it was anxiety and stress well i think he was wrong because of the gp from my new doctor has only let me see the nurse who told me that my ears needing waxing well a lot of the tension has gone not all i'm still like a few getting it around the nose and eyes my neck and shoulder i've been doing the exercises from the physio and no they are not working so it is maybe just time that sorts this out if we over do it i feel we suffer i've cut out all medication except oils and vitamins and going for mind over matter like your son said lulu the mullein is helping with the mucus but that could be the walking i've got some issues with twitching eyes hands and legs at different times now and again may be caused by the tension but overall am feeling a lot better get that horrible feeling every few days but carry on and it goes so hopefully we will all be better soon gary",
          "hi lulu i hope you're niece is okay i like you feel we have been told what the gps feel at the time they now know more about it but so do all of us as you know i never had to use a doctor before this only had a muscle spasm in my back once and basically get on with it with pain relief should have just done the same with this little sugar nightmare and got on with it with everyone else on here anyway still got lots of issues but hey ho going back to work sunday morning and feel better than i did two weeks ago so will cut out the walking and save my energy for the week after saturday enjoy the sunshine \u2600 and hopefully everyone is feeling better today gary",
          "hi jim think you are spot on just got to up it gradually now and again and don't over do it i've been doing the exercises but feel like it's just going to take time for it to ease gradually i've decided mind over matter and get on with it we will have bad days but now they are being outnumbered by the good ones and i know you have improved considerably since about 6 weeks ago just keep sticking to it gary",
          "morning gary,i honestly think we have to accept that it is going to take months to be better. horrid thought but even when we feel okay we must pace ourselves. small blocks of doing things, rest then a bit more etc.i've had my ct scan this morning, which took 10 minutes. a strange day, i actually had a reason to get up and times to adhere to. bizzare. just as though covid never happened.the two nurses were lovely. they quizzed me about covid and my experience.they were shocked at how we've been left from the beginning to now.have a good day gary.",
          "exactly jim i agree with you ive actually been a naughty boy because i saw what lulu said about mind over matter and thought i would try and forget about it and do what i normally do so i went to the pub for a few drinks and then went again the following day and had a few more and i have to say don't feel any different so i'm going to to exercise walk take the vitamins and oil and if i fancy going out i will not too much because the dehydration still worries me and now see how long it will take for the tension to go l hope your ct scan comes back and you will be fine in time because looks like that is what it is going to take gary *",
          "gary,i mentioned to my gp i was going to have a drink. she said take it steady, one or two.as per her advice i've stuck to that and i've had no ill effects that i can tell.i've ditched the medication bar the mucoydne and i'm aiming to up my walking by 500 steps a week.work will have to wait till october, at which point they will have to adjust my duties to suit my physical status.apparently, they can reduce my hours upto two months, so reduced hours are in order i think.have you heard from majeic?",
          "yes i understand that especially with the acid reflux as well i have tension and tight chest problems still just using oils and gel supplements not heard from maciek i think the page is a problem too far down i did message him a week ago or more but he must be back to normal i hope gary",
          "afternoon guys,how is everyone this afternoon?this lovely weather seems to make my chest heavy. anyone else the same?also, there is a never ending supply of throat mucus. err!!",
          "not me mate but i'm sitting with my daughter in the front room with a fan on jim i'm afraid i'm getting lots of tension on my head neck and shoulders this afternoon i took some more mullein leaf oil before i came out so it might be keeping it at bay till later on gary",
          "thanks gary.",
          "hi jimyes still plenty of mucus, and i think the heat affects my chest/stomach. everything feels harder work, but i guess there's a lot of healing going on, i think that's what's causing the tiredness.my walk today was a trip to the local shops, that was enough.keep cool everyonehope your niece is ok lulu, it must be really worrying for you.",
          "hi everyonei literally haven't stepped outside the house today! ive had the busiest day so far at work and coped pretty well so am happy with that and was good for taking my mind off things. i have a lot of thick throat mucus and was coughing a lot this morning but suddenly have stopped this afternoon - that is what is so weird about this whole thing the way symptoms start and stop so quickly. glad you've had scan jim and it must be good to be getting looked at finally. sounds like you are doing well gary and agree just do as much as you are comfortable with - i knew i was overdoing it weds but still did it in the hope would get away with it but guess what?? i didn't!! - no-one to blame but myself \ud83d\ude44some days easier to be positive than others but slept well last night and it makes such a difference so as well as pacing we need to make sure we get as much sleep as possible - having said that not sure tonight is looking hopeful at 28 degrees in the night!enjoy the weekend everyone, we are probably due to change page - over to you gary \ud83d\ude02 should we leave it till monday so susan, steph, stuart and others see this before we go?!!lx",
          "hi jo,i feel your pain.the drive across sheffield for the scan and 2k walk when i got home knocked me out.fell asleep watching tv with my son.it's unbelievable what this virus has done.on a better note i had a walk after my dinner and feel fine, so it's gin time.hope you have a lovely evening.jim.",
          "thanks jo and everyone for asking about my niece she has had test just waiting for result. hope mucus improves jo and definitely the heat is not helping us. let's hope it is not too long before it cools down. i remember us all thinking the same back in april/may but it wasn't anywhere like this!take care everyone and enjoy the gin, jim!lx",
          "morning everyone yes the heat is a nightmare lulu think you're right moving the page on monday so everyone knows i was feeling a bit better but for some reason the tension won't go from the head shoulders and neck my eyes are twitching now and again and sore in the shower part and parcel of the healing i suppose i'm back to work early in the morning so just going to chill today going to be a long week if it stays hot gary",
          "morning gary,it seems as though anything can set bloody symptoms off.i've done my usual routine and i must have coughed up nigh on half a cup of mucus.disgusting.the old hooter seems to be making more mucus these days too. i've no idea why.take it steady pal.jim.",
          "morning jim yes mate i have given up trying to work it out now i'm not sure what is going to happen next we have ridden it for a long time now so i suppose wouldn't surprise me what happens next anymore try and enjoy your day gary",
          "morning everyone!i am trying a new tactic of not overdoing it and see if it make a difference!! been to see my mum, did a short walk of around 2000 steps (taking leaf out of jim's book and not doing 8000 any more!) popped into m&s food and have friends over tonight so am just going to sit around all afternoon and not talk too much - talking definitely affects my throat etc. have ditched the gaviscon as was making my throat feel more mucusy carrying on with the lansoprazole and mucodyne. i bailed out and slept in spare room last night and had windows wide open and felt better for it - my partner can hear someone sneeze in scotland so doesn't like the windows wide open and i wonder if the lack of air makes me feel worse in mornings?i get a lot of the tension in my shoulders and neck gary and same as you some days worse than others without any reason. take it easy today and maybe take some flarin - it might help if it is caused by the inflammation or if tension will relax you maybe? anyway hope it eases off for you with work tomorrow.am feeling pretty good so far today (watch me jinx myself \ud83d\ude33) so am going to try and forget about covid today and will check in tomorrow with the outcome of my new not overdoing it routine!my niece tested negative so good news - do wonder if the testing is accurate though as unusual to have these symptoms at this time of year but she followed all the correct guidance and is now back out on the streets!!lx",
          "yep let's move page on monday \ud83d\ude1c",
          "hi lulu some good news that you're niece is okay i'm very sceptical about all the tests they do or have done there is now a report saying that they think the vaccine is already only 98 percent knowing our luck we will hit the 2percent the tension is very weird and i feel i'm going to have to work with it as well works easy enough at the moment so i can deal with it hopefully i'm hoping the head tension will go first i can deal with the neck and shoulder oh the joys sorry read the report wrong they don't know what the efficiency will be 50 60 75percent one day they might get one right we can only hope gary",
          "morning,well, i don't know what the weather is like elsewhere but here it's like autumn. misty, drizzling and gloomy.on a brighter note, i walked further yesterday divided into three blocks. i've got to remember to pace myself.have a great day.jim.",
          "1. hi jim started the same as that getting warmer now at work not too much to do which is good for me the tension on my head head has has eased right down hoping it stays that way good have a day mate gary",
          "take it steady gary and have a good day.",
          "that's good news about your niece, lulu, must be a huge relief for you all. hope you're still feeling good and not overdoing it.i survived a glass of wine last night :) had a mad moment yesterday though when i decided to use some spray bleach. i wore a mask and i'd been ok using it before, but the smell must have lingered and affected my nose/chest for several hours. i won't be doing that again, and there won't be any painting being done here for a while!feeling generally more normal though, and like everyone, trying not to overdo it. i have to keep remembering to pace myself.all the best everyone :)",
          "thanks jo, yes was relieved although she is in her 30s and healthy you just never know.good reason not to do any housework i'd say! i am ok with the sprays now but good idea to wear a mask. funny how we learn everything the hard way. we had friends over last night and i did pace myself during the day as i said yesterday and felt pretty good and am ok today \ud83d\ude4c i just have to keep reminding myself as i feel lazy sitting around too much but think it is necessary in between activities.still struggling with the mucus in the back of throat/right lung and shoulders very achey- seems better when it shifts which can be at any point in the day but then comes back. how are you getting on with symptoms now and such good news you are feeling more \"normal\"!!lx",
          "hi lului'm finding i can ignore symptoms to some extent unless i overdo it or do the wrong thing. i still get the swollen sometimes sore stomach so have to be careful what i do, and blocked nose, chest congestion and of course, mucus.but it's starting to be more in the background so long as i pace myself. i've had a bit of a sore lung/back, not sure which and don't know what's caused it, maybe walking a little bit further?sounds like you're getting there too, i know what you mean about sitting around, i'm not very good at it either! yes, i'm a bit fed up with the mucus, especially when it decides i need to deal with it late at night. enjoy your evening x",
          "i am probably same jo not really stopping me doing anything but am aware of the mucus in back of throat it is worse at different times of day but can't work out what makes it worse or better. i have a bad ache in my right shoulder/lung some days worse than others and sometimes the burn in the windpipe when i inhale so there must still be some inflammation going on.anyway thankfully seems like everyone is doing much better and it really does just seem to be that time is the healer.take care, don't forget we are going to move onto next page tomorrow - whoever posts first tomorrow is in charge of that - gary?!!lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone, was writing a whole long post and then knocked my phone and lost it so quick update because i can't rewrite all that.doing okayish, a bit jittery today and nauseous, brain fog on friday, forgot to put salt in my bread recipe and detergent in a load of laundry!going away with the fam tomorrow to somerset for a few days and quite anxious about it, and weather forecast not helping...yikes!",
          "hi danegreat to hear from you. i think the brain fog is a definite thing but maybe we are more aware of everything at moment. i do stuff like that all the time and keep dropping things - wonder if that is a symptom?!will be great to get away, am sure it will be lovely being with family and they will help you knowing how ill you've been - it's all about pacing yourself apparently \ud83d\ude44!! (says me who never does!!) but am trying hard to now as am so fed up with the weekly set backs when i don't. let us know how it goes, have fun!lx",
          "thanks lulu, i'm packing up for everyone so let's hope the brain fog doesn't result in a bunch of things getting left behind!i'm trying to pace myself too but def notice there are days i can do more and days i can do less, days where i feel like i'm almost back to my old self and days when i wonder why i'm still struggling, but we must be nearly there!will let you know how the trip goes \ud83d\ude42",

          "hi everyone!found you!! i love the sound of the dip - do you live by the sea jim? i would love a swim in the sea am hoping the weather holds until next week. good work on the steps too.hope work ok gary, drink plenty of water (not peroni!!) and chill out this evening. i think we underestimate going away res, when i went on 4th july i really struggled but think it was just too soon. so glad you found it good for you overall and sure you will bounce back - i know exactly what you mean i had a real coughy day on thursday and started wondering if i had pneumonia! hate feeling so worried all the time but it is understandable after going through this. i am trying to do my yoga every morning and it helps me a lot.i have felt the best today that i have felt for months - i paced myself all over the weekend - did everyting i wanted to but literally rested in between. also stopped the gaviscon advance i am pretty sure i do not have reflux i think it is just inflammation in my airways from the virus and the gaviscon was making my mucus feel more cloggy. any way enjoying feel well and just praying it will last.take care everyonelx",

          "lol!! or i see he meant a downward dip! i must have holidays on my mind!! funny how easy to read things out of context!how is your breathing feeling now? is it back to normal? i wouldn't say mine is completely better but much better than it was. i reckon everyone struggling today with this heat gary - there is just no air and must be hard for you and everyone working. think it cools down end of week and you can guarantee it will be raining and cold next week when i go away - don't think ive ever been away when it isn't - except of course when we go abroad and then a heatwave starts in the uk as we go up the steps of the plane \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44lx",

          "yes only people who understand are those who have either been through it themselves or know someone close to them. i really think we are on the home stretch gary but we mustn't overdo it - i know easy for me to say as only working a couple of days but if you feel rough phone in sick and take a day off don't just push through. get early nights and rest!!such a relief the breathing is better that was the worst part and the sore throat - my throat is just beginning to look normal after 5 months!take care, we will be cracking open a bottle of sparkly soon - i reckon another month - 6 months in total which is exactly what specialist told me 4 - 6 months - same recovery time as for pneumonia.lx",

          "hi everyonei'm on the right page now!so we're all getting there at our own pace. just been to work for a couple of hours, not as tired as last week, so i'm giving myself a score of 9. but i'll be there for a while as i'm far from normal regarding getting out and about. i couldn't imagine going away this year, and like you, jim, christmas seems to be more realistic for me. slowly but surely :)",
          "hi jo glad you found us!!brilliant i think you were you 8.5 last week? glad you've made some progress. i'm probably stuck on 93/4 for a while too! good you are not so tired this week i noticed the same when i look back to my first week at work over 4 weeks ago i can see quite a bit of improvement and also feel my confidence coming back \ud83d\ude4c so long as we all are improving and will fully recovery that is the only important thing. i am a bit worried about going away as last time wasn't that successful as felt really unwell although at the time i thought i felt much better than i had been feeling (not difficult!) will be interesting this time - it will be exactly 5 weeks since last trip and going to same place so will be a good comparison!take care jo, happy you are heading in right direction.lx",
          "morning!google guardian covid long haul why some people are not getting better - really interesting podcast - it is one of the guardian reporters being interviewed luke harding been sick since march - first thing he mentions is he is on omeprazole for refluz! take a listen when you have time it is about 15/20 mins. have good day everyone.l x",
          "thanks lulu, that's really interesting, and so true. it's reassuring as well that we will get hopefully recover from this virus.i'm feeling a lot better, but after working yesterday, and the heat, my hr did a huge spike. i had a lift to work and felt fine afterwards so set off to get the bus home. i checked my hr and it was very high, so i got a taxi. it gets quite high when i'm walking, but never that high. maybe it was too much walking in that heat after working and being normal.hope you have a lovely holiday lulu, i'm sure you will as you have recovered so much, and you know how to pace yourself! :)",
          "yes it's reassuring to know so many people and medical staff in the same boat - that is why i believe people are now taking notice of people who have been ill since march as has affected medical professionals too and people will listen to them and not pass it off as anxiety. it sounds like it was combination of work and heat - the heat is so intense at the moment and humidity high the worse combination for us. sounds like you did the right thing though getting a taxi i think we need to listen to our bodies.my friend who i do my 4/5 mile hilly hikes with is out of action at moment as she fell off her bike but think maybe i am feeling better doing shorter 2/3 mile walks - so will carry on with that for time being and yes, of course, pacing myself \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02 - i used to cram something into every second of every day - i'd never say no to a lunch or meeting with friends - i am now limiting myself to one social event a day!! i recover on my work days as i sit at a pc all day and can't leave house so i look at thurs/fri as my days of physical rest!take care, hope hr is more consistent today.lx",
          "hi everyone i've found you on page 72. i've just listened to the podcast lulu thanks for sharing. sounds so familiar we all seem to have had similar symptoms. my breathing's not been great but i think the weather's effecting it. hope everyone's ok",
          "hi guys,the heat doesn't help my breathing at all. i don't know if anyone else is the same?it's very close here tonight and from the forecast it's going to be very humid for the next couple of days.hope you all sleep well.",
          "yep have struggled more today too jim - chest feels a bit tight which always make me anxious.take care,lx",
          "looks like another incredibly hot humid day again.lets hope our breathing stands up to it.have a great day everyone.",
          "hi jim and everyoneyep another scorcher. just done a walk in the woods so was a bit cooler now off to see a friend. how you getting on? my mucus seems less but still builds up every couple of days and chest goes a bit tight. seems better when i walk and keep moving - funnily enough sitting down for too long seems to make it worse than ever so need to keep on the move but also pace myself \ud83d\ude44 - it's complicated getting it right isn't it? too little exercise not good and too much not good either!! how amazing will it be when we don't have to think about this stuff any more.lx",
          "oh lulu i can't wait to be able to do things without planning etc.i'm alright today. we've just had a picnic up on the strines, which is moorland in the middle of nowhere. glorious.i finally feel happy to be alive.",

          "steph,watch the video in nasal spray use on asthma uk website. it will ensure you apply it correctly.",
          "thanks jim just watched it. i'm just excited about the mucus tabs working, because till now i've not had any it's all still in the back of my throat and chest !! i hope it's start moving now i'm taking tablets.",
          "fingers crossed for you steph.if the mucus is at the back of your throat get your gp to prescribe an acid reflux tablet. apparently that can cause it.",
          "i know that feeling jim - i had that feeling about 3/4 weeks ago when we went to friend's for dinner - it was the first time for months i felt somewhere near normal and felt so happy! am so so pleased for you i really am. you have turned the corner! lx",
          "how times have changed steph when we can get excited about mucus tablets! great you've got them and hope they help. i am too scared to stop taking have been on them from the start but now down from 6 to 2 a day. trying to wean myself off all the meds but have been talking too much today so just had to pop a couple of flarin - not sure i've done very well with the pacing today!take care,lx",
          "that's made me laugh lulu thanks. yes i've given up most of the meds, give our bodies a break. you're making up for lost time lol just take it easier tomorrow. you'll be ok in front of your laptop working from home tomorrow it has its advantages . think i could get use to working from home permanently !! xx",
          "lulu,yet again thank you for your positivity.this has been and remains the hardest challenge of my life but as you say i've turned a corner. there's a way to go but we'll all get there.",
          "morning guys and girls looking good to see everyone getting somewhere i think i'm not certain but the mullein leaf i take twice a day has helped with the mucus i have come off all medication just using vitamins and oils i've given up with gps don't know why i changed should have just carried on with what we were doing i've got today and tomorrow then resting for the weekend i have had to pace myself at work but so glad most of the tension has eased waiting game now unless it's got a surprise symptom to give me enjoy your day gary",
          "hi everyone :)yes great to see we're all returning to normality with fewer symptoms to deal with. we've definitely done a lot of it ourselves with limited help, but we're getting there.good luck with your mucus tablets steph, it reminds me of how excited i was when i first sneezed, after being completely blocked up for several weeks. i'd tried everything, even sniffing pepper to get a reaction!well i'm so glad it's a bit cooler, i've found it quite draining this week. i've managed to get a nice walk in before the rain came, half an hour on the flat still seems to be enough, so i'll stick with that for nowenjoy your day",
          "all good news seems to be going on with most of us now it would be so good to get over the finish line but more improvement is good news joanne got to still hold back for a couple more weeks before i push it again great that the tempature has dropped off gary",
          "a good sneeze is the best feeling! the blocked nose was awful - felt like head was going to spontaneously combust! i thankfully didn't have it for too long maybe a couple of weeks but i do randomly get one nostril block completely - all very strange.still waiting for the rain here - very humid and muggy. just hope it clears for when i am away next week and get some sunshine without melting temperatures.sounds like you are making good progress jo with the walks etc. and generally am feeling a lot of positive vibes on here over the last few days \ud83e\udd1e don't think this weather will have been helping us so maybe when it cools down we will feel even better \ud83d\ude00enjoy rest of day everyone,lx",
          "hi all hurray can get on here now. its good to read everyone improving especially jim \ud83d\ude0d like all of you i'm doing ok i give myself 9 3/4 this week still not 100% but have more energy now and doing alot more running around with the grandkids. lulu i went swimming in the sea where i live on tues it was so warm i was scared at first incase it made my breathing bad again but all ok. its so nice to be on the other side of this virus now \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",
          "have been wondering where you were susan!! that's brilliant - am so hoping can swim in the sea next week - will let you know, just weather dependent.so lovely you can do all the things you enjoy again and can't agree more such a relief to be feeling so much better. i am the same definitely not 100% but feel like things are improving more quickly now. brilliant, we are both 93/4 so nearly there! if the government put out a statement saying if you catch a mild/moderate case and even if not hospitalised it can take 6 months or more to recover perhaps people would follow the guidelines better - i really wish they would. the mild flu message has made everyone complacent.take care, lx",
          "i read a article about the long haul and they recognise it now that some people are taking months to feel alot better. one guy fit and young is still really bad after 4 mths spends half the day in bed and half up its so bad he went to hospital and they said recovering pneumonia and sent him home that was before we got tested as well. they were saying if all your bloods come back normal you def had covid all of ours did apart from a little higher white cell result which meant fighting virus off. i'll find out what it was called",
          "it's called long covid.",
          "it is really good that there is more information out there now about how long the recovery period can be and we are definitely not alone. i have also been told it is a similar recovery time to pneumonia for many which seems to be around 6 months. i follow the #longcovid on twitter - it is interesting to hear what others think and are going through also good to hear people are gradually recovering.enjoy the evening.lx",
          "hey everyone,back from holiday, it was lovely and i did surprisingly well! not a relaxing holiday with 4 adults and 8 children more like non-stop action \ud83d\ude04 we ended up doing some really active stuff with climbing loads of stairs and walking for ages up hills to see the most beautiful views. it was really hot so i found it quite difficult but i think everyone else complained way more so i felt really normal \ud83d\ude01. found i just got put in situations that pushed my assumed comfort barrier like having to piggy back my son while walking on a mountain or doing a desperate run with another child who urgently needed the toilet when we were in middle of a massive country park and actually apart from mild muscle aches, feel ok after all that. oh and went for a first swim (a short one cos i was worried to overdo it but hey, i did it!). best thing was to see the children having a good time and creating lovely memories \u2764 topped it off with a pizza and milkshake dinner when we got home, haven't eaten pizza in ages because of worries with reflux, but as the holiday was wild, decided to go all the way!great to read your posts and see that things are looking up all round. super!",
          "that is such amazing news!! am so pleased you had a wonderful time and spent quality time with your family. swimming in sea sounds amazing! hoping i cope as well next week when i go away with my son as i am so looking forward to spending time with him!my reflux seems so much better too - still taking the lansoprazole but seeing specialist 1st september and hoping can stop. take care, lx",
          "thanks lulu. am very relieved and pleased it went well.swim was in a pool at the cottage we stayed in, mostly was too knackered from our trips to try a swim but one time it was so hot and the pool looked so refreshing that went for it. swim in the sea also sounds great so hope you manage to do that on your holiday. it really is good to get away for a bit. hope you get good weather, we were supposed to have thundery showers nearly every day but weather was fine in the end.great your reflux is going, not sure i have it any more, still taking famotidine just in case. must have been some inflammation that has now settled down. am supposed to book in for an endoscopy to check, not sure it's needed, but hubby says to go for any test i'm offered, he's probably right!",
          "well, what a difference a couple of days makes.sunny yorkshire is overcast, foggy with drizzle but it's still quite warm.i hope everyone has a lovely day.",
          "don't think will be as lucky as you with weather but sure it will be fine and good to be away! i'll keep you posted about the swim in the sea that may have been a bit optimistic!!i am still taking lansoprazole - i don't think i ever had reflux i think i just presented with the same symptoms as reflux but was in fact all the inflammation of throat from the virus. i had an endoscopy and would definitely say have it if you can - it is not at all painful and it is good to get properly checked out. my voice box is still not 100% right and gets a bit sore/achey but that is my own fault as i talk too much \ud83d\ude02 specialist said to rest voice for 6/8 weeks to give time to heal but easier said than done!! so glad you are feeling much better.lx",
          "how are you jim, still progressing well?hope you can rest over the weekend gary after a long, hot week at work.hope everyone else is doing well and looking forward to the weekend \ud83d\ude00lx",

          "hi everyone i'm so pleased to read everyone's on the mend it's fab news...joanne thanks for good luck with mucus tablets, nothing yet but i think they take time to kick in. dane you've done really well being away from home on holiday and going back to eating normally well done you !! lulu, jim, gary hope you're all having gd days. i'm off work now for 2 weeks. i have said to work mates that this time i'm off work i'll hopefully enjoy as before i've been off was really ill, it was not a holiday. hope you enjoy your weekends everyone.",
          "hi everyone i have made it through the week at work but my boy decided to get into some trouble with other boys so had today go police station and early this morning had to ring work and tell them i had to take emergency leave so it was more tiring than going to work felt tingling in my hands and legs not sure if that's the fatigue took him home a couple of hours ago nothing serious so his mum can smack his back side i've got the weekend off so i will take it easy start seven nights next week and feeling like it will be tough but so was this week i'm so glad everyone is feeling a lot better tension really for me came back today it is easing still a little problem with the eyes still stinging but i like the rest of us would rather be where i am now than two months ago hoping everyone has a good weekend gary",
          "that's good news. i think that is what we are supposed to be doing resting in between so sounds like you are pacing yourself perfectly!had a good couple of days at work getting more confident and all going well. just felt my sinus start a bit today but think that is the change in temperature but would never have had this before! enjoy your weekend.lx",
          "amazing, enjoy your two weeks off steph and so good you feel better and can enjoy it. i was thinking today wouldn't mind doing another lockdown now i feel better and i could actually enjoy not rushing around and get all the jobs done that everyone else did during that time. have fun!lx",
          "have been there gary having two boys myself and know it is very stressful - they do stupid things and takes them a while to mature! glad nothing serious and you can rest over weekend before your night shifts. think stress makes symptoms much worse probably why the tension came back. have noticed if i am rushing around and am late my breathing gets worse so am trying to leave myself plenty of time and not get too stressed out.enjoy the weekend.take care,lx",
          "yes i know lulu he is a little sugar some times back with his mate who is a bit more wiser than some of his other friends so will keep an eye on him for a few weeks needs to get back to school tension eased again now i'm hoping we are all in the home stretch and we seem to be so like you said before mind over matter might be the way to the finish line it's a horrible day here so resting could be good hope everyone has a good weekend gary",

          "just fighting with it now pal.take care.",
          "you're win it just keep battling gary",
          "yep think all the kids need to get back to school and people need to get back to work if they can safely. do you feel \"safe\" at work or does it stress you out being in contact with others? do you wear a mask? no sign of us going back to office any time soon.hope everyone else doing well think the change of weather/temperature affects sinus - i think that hot weather actually did us all good even though it was pretty unbearable we all seemed to improve quite a lot last ten days or so - maybe we need to go and live somewhere hot and sunny!enjoy your day.lx",
          "hi everyone :)i tried to post yesterday but it took ages, as it kept freezing, then it deleted my post! seems fine today thoughgreat we're all recovering, holiday sounds fab, dane. you must be going soon, lulu, i don't think i could cope with all that packing etc, it takes me ages to get ready to go out for a couple of hours!hope all settled down with your son, gary, kids are a worry, but luckily we're more able to cope with it now, even though it still stresses usi survived another shopping trip by bus yesterday, and there was a huge difference from when i did the same trip 3 weeks ago. i was fine wearing the mask this time and still had plenty of energy left when i got home. things are looking up :) :)hope everyone has a great weekend",
          "morning lulu i feel safe at work that's not a problem because i know all my mates and staff are not showing any signs of being unwell and a lot of people are still working from home i don't suffer from stress or anxiety that's why i think the doctor was wrong to say i was i'm not using any medication now either just vitamins and oils if i get a fierce headache i still have some flarin just speaking to my sister who agrees the kids need to get back to school i'm tired today but got a chance to rest up enjoy your weekend lulu and everyone else gary",
          "hi joanne its good news your starting to feel better about the bus and shopping i was watching in the police station yesterday morning when they were all coming to work and go through the same door i was thinking do they have hand sanitizer the other side of the door or do they do it when they get to their office because it only takes one to start off the chain reaction silly really but i went through the door with an officer and didn't touch it i suppose they must do enjoy your weekend gary",
          "hi jogreat news that you have improved since 3 weeks ago - i find that is the best way to gauge progress looking back to things you have done a few weeks before and comparing. really pleased things are getting easier for you and you have got used to wearing mask - it's not ideal with the breathing issues but think that is now improving for most of us too.am a bit anxious about going away on monday as holidays are often more stressful than we think - i remember that from last time!enjoy the weekend.lx",
          "ah that's good that you feel safe at work - i agree i think the only anxiety was being ill with c-19 and not knowing which way it was going to go. i'm the same definitely not an anxious person. good you are off the meds i am going to wait till early september when i see the respiratory guy and ent guy and speak to them - can see them both in person this time as opposed to a phone consultation. flarin works well and i'm same if my throat sore or headache etc i just take it and it seems to settled it down.i feel tired today too think just after hot busy week and have been doing much more. you are entitled to feel tired after working all week!lx",
          "agree lulu i think when we were a couple of months into it and not knowing what to expect next we would have been anxious but when i last went to the hospital i was not sure what the doctors were saying about anxiety and stress or depression they probably told a lot of people who had to deal with it at home the same thing and sent them on their way i am really calm now but still getting tension headaches and earaches only slightly and now and again and tight chest you rest up for the rest of the weekend gary",
          "happy hols lulurelax and enjoy :) x",
          "thanks jo! have had the head cold feeling again and tight chest today seems to be the change in weather - just hoping it will pass.anyone else had a problem since the weather changed? just seem super sensitive to everything now and was never sensitive to anything before this!hope everyone doing well.lx",
          "yes i've felt congested last few days, nose blocked, chest a bit tight when walking. must be the weather. can't win! i prefer this weather as i have more energy but don't like this blocked up feeling, and lots of mucus too.hope weather improves for you x",
          "it must be the weather too much of a coincidence. yes the heat was unbearable but think humidity is still quite high.just seems that it is all extremes this year nothing is settled - including the weather!take care,lx",
          "morning everyone lulu enjoy your time away hoping everyone is well i'm not sure how long we have left with the little sugar i'm hoping soon we will be there a lot of tension has eased from my head and ears i'm still getting it across the shoulder and neck and tight chest heavy hands and legs that's it i have to start nights tonight that will be interesting gary",
          "morning!just about to leave but all the roads around here are flooded - not a good start! feeling a bit doomed this year was hoping for a reprieve and be blessed with some sunshine this week but not looking too hopeful \ud83d\ude02 it rained every day when we went away in july too!good luck with nights gary - must be a bit daunting for you, try not to over do it. i am feeling very chesty since the weather changed - feeling a bit fed up with all the extremes - extreme heat, extreme rain, extreme covid!! anyway catch up with everyone during the week, take care and hope you have a good week and continue to improve. hoping the sea air will help!lx",

          "that's good jim did he say how long before the inflammation settles or goes or when the mucus will stop being a problem gary",
          "unfortunately, he couldn't put a time limit on it gary.as he said, its a new virus no one knows.i can understand his point it would be guess work.",

          "sorry to hear that, dane, it's really disappointing when you start to feel better and that happens. as lulu says, though, it could be the change in weather. i felt better last week, even though the heat drained me, but i'm really tired this week, with tight chest etc.great news about your ct scan, jim, that must be a huge relief, really pleased for you.good luck with nights, gary, hope all goes okhope you're ok, steph and we all start to see the end of more of these symptoms",
          "evening everyone. i've been following this page since the beginning. i am unfortunately one of the long haul sufferers. i'm just wondering if any one has symptoms of pressure on the nose , popping in the ears and jaw pain at times?never suffered with the sinuses before this year.thanks",
          "hi tarayes i've had those symptoms, i still get nose blocking and sometimes ear problems. all these problems seem to come and go. steaming and seawater nose spray seem to help with sinuses, but it still keeps coming back. hope you can get some relief from it",

          "hi joanne thank you i'm not busy at work tonight so should be ok i'm getting pains in my left chest near my nipple tonight hopefully they will do one still getting tight chest now and again keeping hoping that will do one oh well gotta crack on with it hopefully a good day tomorrow for us all gary",
          "hi tara yes i have had pressure on the nose and popping in the ear not the jaw pain though gary",
          "the exercise is a minefield.i've tried to push myself a little more last few days and chest tightened right up and not stopped coughing. even my rib cage aches.saw my respiratory consultant again today and he says he still thinks its just scarring of my lungs and inflammation but he wants to see me in 6 weeks again before virus season starts as he said i should be noticing real improvements by then. he wants to check my immune system also, just incase something is amiss there as i have a history of long respiratory illness without any known underlying conditions and he wants to check whats going on there covid aside before the next virus season comes round. am glad it's a little cooler now too! that heat didn't help!",
          "morning everyone!that is such amazing news jim!! - it is so reassuring and if there is no damage you know it must just be the healing process - need to remind ourselves of that when we have a bad day. my son said to me yesterday about body healing and said do you remember when you broke your ankle and you thought it would never heal? it is same as that took months and it was so gradual then suddenly it was healed but with a few twinges every now and again so probably be same! sadly the body takes so much longer to heal the older you are.having a really chilled time, my son is so good for me to be around - great to chat to and super positive and sees the best in everything - couple of evenings i've said i'm really tired after being out all day he has said yes so am i and i'm only 26 - sometimes i think i expect a lot of myself!dane so sorry you had a dip but pretty sure you will come back from that quickly - it is so unsettling though never knowing exactly how you are going to feel day to day especially with kids and you need to plan things - must be so hard.gary hope you are doing ok with the night shifts and your mates are helping you out if you need it.res, lovely to hear from you sorry still having problems with chest, you are definitely not alone we all seem to still be getting that. i am finding pure peppermint tea helps if you drink in evening - think it is the pepermint oil that helps.jo - sounds same as me i was better in the heat once i'd adjusted but feel better now but could be the sea air. i am still doing my overall body assessment when i wake up every morning to see what am dealing with!! if my chest feels ok i am happy! spoke to guy in shoe menders before i left and he told me he had it early march still struggling with chest tightness and then met a friend who is a fireman, super fit, in his 40s and same story - it is taking a long time as we all know but we will get there.anyway sorry for the long waffle am waiting for my son to wake up!, stay positive and catch up when i'm back next week.lx",
          "lulu,enjoy your holiday and spend that quality time with your son.i saw a program yesterday and the doctor was going through post viral fatigue. apparently, the syndrome is associated will various viral illnesses.they do take a long time to recover from, eg glandular fever etc.unfortunately, its a waiting game.on a lighter note, we're all improving.",
          "evening,how is everyone been today?i woke up this morning and my chest felt clearer than normal but it has become congested through the day.anyone else the same?",
          "hi jim i seem to have been congested on and off all day. it doesn't seem to have stopped me doing anything though, just been annoyingly there.lulu, sounds like you're having a lovely time with your son, he sounds really supportive and helpful in his advice to you. it's useful sometimes to hear someone else's point of view especially as he is so positive about it.hope you're feeling better soon, res, and things improve for you",

          "hi jim not made it through the nights yet i have two more to go and like dane i'm feeling it but work at the moment is not as hard as it was last year otherwise i wouldn't have been able to do it plus we have covid rules so when we finish we get to go home last night was the toughest so far my symptoms have eased somewhat and i'm hoping tonight will be easier my hands and legs feel heavy i'm hoping everyone is improving and lulu is enjoying her holiday gary",

          "just keep doing what you can jim i have been lucky this week i have felt fatigue but had an easy week really i will start walking again tomorrow haven't done that since last week wanted to conserve my energy a week goes by so quickly now i think maciek would have recovered by now he seemed to be a really strong character hopefully stuart is getting somewhere as well gary",

          "welcome back lulu, sounds like you had a lovely time :)it's a weird one that congestion, i thought it was usually worse in the wet weather, but today has been torrential rain, and it doesn't seem quite as bad. oh well, we never know what to expect next!the only medication i'm taking is the omeprazole, i tried to go down to one capsule a couple of times but the indigestion came back. looks like i'll be on them for a while, i noticed on my prescription it said review due next january!",
          "hi jo, everyonei have given up trying to work it out but think i definitely suffer when there is a change in weather - seem to be super sensitive to everything these days! had the head cold feeling and sore throat today - not had that for a while so makes a change \ud83d\ude02 had really congested chest last night but woke up this morning and seemed better - it's all so weird. i have decided after i have seen specialists i am going to try and get gp to refer me to one of the local post covid hubs set up - surely that is the least the gps can do after having had to fend for ourselves for 6 months?! i also think it is a good idea to get acknowledged in the nhs covid system and hopefully be monitored over the next year or so. am feeling a bit weary of trying to fathom this all out without any medical support.hope everyone has had a good day despite the weather!lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone, typical bank holiday weather , hope it gets better. my chest feels tight and congestion bad feels like a never ending cold. good call on asking to be referred to covid hub lulu. when i asked they said that as i was coping i didn't need to be referred. now it's nearly 6 months i think we deserve to be seen and like you mentioned be on their radar. hope you're all doing ok",
          "hi lulu i was just thinking it would be close to six months soon a long time to do this with basically no help really i'm starting to wonder about the throat and tight chest i'm feeling good but like you i'm still unsure maybe they go when the lungs heal glad most of tension has gone i was going to wait to see what the ent specialist says when she rings back must be due soon i changed my holiday back in april to next month don't fancy that either will go somewhere next year with my kids it's good that you had a good time last week it shows how much better we are getting gary",
          "yep we are approaching our six month anniversary gary!! - i am see ent specialist tuesday so will ask him lots of questions - he was really helpful when i saw him a couple of month ago and he had also had it which i think helps. then following week seeing respiratory consultant, another one who had it too! so will ask him loads of questions!! if you do the same when ent rings you maybe we will get some more answers between us. i still think the throat and chest is caused by inflammation - it is slowly getting better but still have flare ups and would like to find out why. have you cancelled your holiday next month? i wouldn't fly at moment but hoping can go early next year as am really missing my son who is now in ny.take care, hope you have something nice planned for the bh weekend.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've had a really lazy week not done a lot at all really ive just got tension on the left side of my ear neck and shoulder and tight chest be interesting to find out from the ent specialist and respiratory consultant lulu i will ask the ent when she rings she said 4 weeks and it is nearly that now i'm concerned about the throat left ear only because the tension seems to stay there and the throat just seems to come and go it might be the tight chest i don't know happy anniversary by the way never thought it would take this long gary",
          "a lazy week must have done you good. i think when i cough the mucus up it makes my throat sore - both the coughing and also think there is something acidic in the mucus which aggravates the throat (sorry not a nice topic for sat morning \ud83e\udd28) was very chesty this morning lots of coughing and then it settles down when i have cleared it and i feel ok but definitely shouldn't still be getting this after so long. have to say am worried about the autumn/winter we definitely can't afford to get a bad cold/chest infection - if i do i think i am going to take antibiotics straight away as a preventative - will ask the respiratory guy about this and see what he says.anyway enjoy the bh weekend, weather is a bit rubbish but we have friends coming over later so can feel a few glasses of prosecco coming on! i'll toast our six month anniversary \ud83e\udd42 \ud83d\ude02take care,lx",
          "hi lulu i kept the antibiotics from my so called chest infection so should be ok incase same thing happens it is weird why we both still have the same problem with the throat i'm pretty sure we will be over everything one day enjoy yourself with your friends i'm going to indulge in a few pints as well later meeting friends to watch football wash some more mucus away gary",
          "yep me too stashed mine away in case i need them! i think so too just think we will be a bit vulnerable this winter and if we get any sign of chesty cough or chest infection need to get straight on the antibiotics. have a great evening, enjoy the beer and the football.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone that's another week done off to work soon not a lot to do so easy week i'm hoping for just a bit of tension across my shoulders and neck tight chest comes and goes little stabs in the back now and again besides that i'm good to go i'm glad the head tension and earaches have gone sore throat feels ok have a good week gary",
          "good news gary hope things continue to improve. had a late night with friends saturday but feel ok and probably in about same place as you. underlying sore throat but seeing guy tomorrow so will ask all the questions about that and everything else and will report back.have a good day and be interested to hear how everyone else is getting on - it has gone pretty quiet last week but generally think that is good news as everyone busy doing other things! i really hope so!lx",
          "yes think your right lulu feeling okay at work can feel the chest and got mucus and tension hopefully everyone else is getting better maybe we have only got a few weeks to be completely there hope so gary",
          "hi everyoneyes feeling more normal, hope everyone else is too. my nose feels clearer, i'm walking a bit faster and a bit further, working more getting out and about more. i think i may be heading for 9 1/2!i'm still confused about the mucus, not sure where it's coming from and how long i should be spending getting rid of it as it sometimes makes my stomach sore. maybe your specialist will have some good advice, lulu.enjoy your day :)",
          "that's great news joanne it certainly is a mystery but getting better is a result in itself i completely forgot about the scoring i would have to go for 9and a half as well maybe in a few weeks we can grab that ten hope the others are getting there as well its been one hell of a slog gary",
          "afternoon all,glad to hear everyone's improving. 9 1/2 is brilliant.can't score myself really, as i've nothing to judge against but i'm far from right.still plagued with intermittent nasal congestion, mucus and fatigue.at least the weathers nice.i read an interesting article on the bmj site, which is for medical professionals etc and how they should look after us. it lists tests and when they should be done etc. they've certainly fallen far from the mark in my case and i'm sure all of yours.keep going everyone, we'll get there.",
          "hi jim i know you have had it rougher than most of us and you are right about the help we have not received i have given up trying with the gps now last time they gave me physio exercises to help me but i gave up on them because they were not working just going to have to rough it through i think i'm hoping not too far off now jim i think you should just try and get yourself better gradually with time looks like we all have tried everything else to some extent gary",
          "hi jo and everyonethat is good news 91/2 and good to hear you are getting out and about more and generally feeling better. i am probably stuck at 93/4 nearly there but still not quite right! did long hilly walk this morning and all the mucus starts up again so will definitely ask about that - think that will be the respiratory guy who i am seeing next week - it is the ent guy tomorrow so will ask about the throat.i agree with gary think between us we have literally tried everything possible to speed up recovery and now it is just down to time and healing. the progress has been so slow sometimes it is hard to see it until you look back a few weeks. will also ask about the nasal congestion jim as i have that quite badly still - i just find the way the symptoms start and stop so randomly hard to deal with. i can wake up with a tight chest and end the day with a sore throat then the next day i feel like i have a head cold with no tight chest and an hour later have no head cold but a sore throat and blocked nose and any combination of the above! lx",
          "i think you're right gary.time is the only thing we have.we'll get there!",
          "thanks lulu,would you be do kind to disclose the questions and answers from your consultant please.",
          "of course jim, appointment is 6.25 tomorrow evening. will try and post when i get back or if not weds morning. as i've said before he is very chatty and upbeat so hoping to get some more info.lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone, glad to hear most are scoring high. good luck with specialist tomorrow lulu. if he has any idea of time frame of when we'll be back to 100% would be good. i thought i was doing ok then had a funny turn on saturday when i was out socialising with friends. thought i was done with paramedics but because i fainted they called one. i'd recovered before they came but got checked out as a precaution. they were happy with all tests and they said only concern was low blood pressure which must've caused it. while i was chatting to paramedics i mentioned my long struggle with covid and they said it's very quiet now but april /may time there were loads of people ill and a lot that should've been hospitalised but weren't , they were left at home !!",
          "hi stephthat must have been awful for you, really scary, but glad you are ok and were checked out properly. might be worth monitoring your bp for a while. i seem to remember being told to drink a large glass of water if it is too low as this pushes it up. i was just saying to my this partner that i think had i been as ill as i was in april/may in normal times, before c19, i would have definitely ended up in hospital and reckon that would have been the same for all of us - it was because we were basically being told to stay at home or if you went to a&e sent home if you could just about breathe that we were not taken in and who knows maybe we would have had the right care and been given some oxygen which would have helped the lungs repair quicker and not had this long ongoing battle - on the other hand it would have been very traumatic to be admitted to hospital and be on your own. interesting though that the paramedic said that. i reckon the government is aware how many people who stayed at home are still unwell and are hoping it will go away - i also think they know more about the seriousness of the virus than they are letting on - even for people with mild cases.i will find out what i can tomorrow - i am definitely going to get my \u00a3250 worth of questions in! - he'll be booting me out the door after 30 mins \ud83d\ude02 i think after 6 months the medics can't just fob us off with \"it's going to take time\" - they must know so much more about the virus by now.take care,lx",
          "hello lulu and everyone. its been a while since i wrote and updated. i'm sorry to see you all here still, and i mean that in the best possible way. last time i posted i was having vision problems and had to keep off the forum as i couldn't focus without headaches. well i got my eyes tested and was told they were fine although i was given an altered prescription that turned out to be wrong - so i had a week of further headaches and eye problems! just what i needed \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02the prescription has been changed now. unfortunately i have had a headache every day since then for the last week. so i don't know if it is virus related or a mixture of that and a bad prescription hurting my eyes. what a palaver.the headache the last few days has felt like i have a low fever to be honest but my temperature seems fine. paracetamol and ibuprofen don't seem to touch it and it's really getting me down. the top of my neck where it connects to the skull is sensitive as well and full of tension. anyone got any good ideas to deal with it? i've also got the breathless thing back with a cough! i was sure that was finally done with but it's back and feeling like it did maybe two months ago. pf results are lower than normal too and energy levels. all a bit disappointing and mood lowering. sorry folks, i'd love to give you a positive update, although i notice lots of good scores from people so that's great. i hope you all get to 10 soon. the throat lump and congestion thing has mellowed and isn't quite so prevalent at least so that's good. has anyone else noticed hair loss? i remarked to my family yesterday that i had never seen so much hair in my comb the last few days. strangely enough later that day i saw a news article mentioning hair loss as another symptom! hopefully it's nothing too baldness inducing \ud83d\ude13anyway enough complaints from me, i never feel good talking about myself like this but i'm sure you can imagine, like all of you, i'm pretty fed up. lulu glad you had a nice break and i hope the appointment goes well and you come back with some useful info. all the best to everyone. have a good day. stuart",
          "hi stuartgreat to hear from you but a shame not better news on health front. maybe the headaches are related to prescription and even when you get a new prescription can take a while for the eyes to adjust so hopefully will settle down. i just go with the flow these days, as i've said, never know what is in store from one hour to the next - was sitting here last night feeling pretty ok and then suddenly felt like had a really bad head cold! not the first time this has happened or probably the last - same with the chest tightness and breathlessness just comes and goes for no particular reason - have literally given up trying to work it out - i used to think it was if i over exercised, then i decided it was because i hadn't exercised, then i thought maybe it was too much dairy and in the end i have absolutely no idea what causes it! i still cough regularly and am still getting rid of mucus a few times a day - all part of normal life these days!have been following #longcovid on twitter - amazing how many people experiencing same symptoms for same length of time as us. pretty certain the government don't want people to know about the huge number of people still sick six months later as no-one would leave the house or go back to work - probably for this reason bj has downplayed his own illness. on a positive we have improved and can only hope the improvements continue but it is hard to see that when you are in the middle of a bad dip.i did read about hair loss but can't say have noticed it but maybe someone else has had similar - seems so many symptoms and everyone gets a different mix of them!take care,lx",
          "hi stuart i've had the headaches i told my gp they were migraines but was told head tension i also get the earaches as well at the moment both did ease but i have overdone it at work an easy day turned into a nightmare they have come back so it looks like if we over do it they will come back like the fatigue i was feeling good this morning not so now early night and see if it affects me in the morning gary",
          "hi gary and everyoneback from appointment. he obviously wanted to know how the last 6 weeks had been and when i told him about all the symptoms coming and going, day to day and even hour to hour, he said that was very (!!)positive \ud83d\ude2f - he said it proves it is nothing sinister and not structural (his exact words!!) if it was he said the symptoms i.e. sore throat or blocked nose would just get worse and worse rather than come and go. he said the virus has caused the lining in the respiratory tract to be more sensitive to everything - pollen, pollution, dust and it will gradually settle down over period of time. he did an endoscopy again and said throat and mucus improved since last time but still some inflammation but nothing to worry about. told me the mucus is the response to the inflammation and as inflammation is subsiding so will the mucus which to be fair it is but very slowly.said to stop taking meds (mucodyne and lansoprazole) see how things are - he said shouldn't need mucodyne now and if throat gets worse again can always start the lansoprazole again. he did ask if i had used the nasal wash he recommended last time (neilmed sinus wash) and when i said no he said should definitely use it as will help with the mucus in nose and back of throat and clear the sinus so have bought that - something else to add to the medical repertoire!i asked if they were making progress with understanding the virus more and he said they had made progress with regards to the lungs but i would need to speak to respiratory consultant who i am seeing next week so not sure if that is going to be good or bad but overall he was quite upbeat and said \"i do believe you will fully recover\" and \"just try and live your life as normally as possible and slowly things will settle down\". am seeing him again in 6 weeks so be interesting to see how things improve and whether can manage without the meds. am really hoping so as have never taken so many tablets in my life - was on 16 a day at one point so to not be taking any will be amazing \ud83d\ude00anyway, hope everyone doing ok, think the constant change in temperature doesn't help us - especially the cold air in the mornings and evenings last few days. lx",
          "hey lulu and everyone, v. interesting what the specialist said, consultant i spoke to weeks ago said the exact same thing about changing symptoms that come and go being a good sign! it sounds strange but i guess it makes sense. mine told me if there was one specific place in my body hurting all the time that would be a concern otherwise its very post viral.good to hear from you stuart and sorry you're still feeling poorly i hope things improve for you soon. i'm still not over my tummy issues that started over a week ago but i'm managing to get by just not feeling very comfortable right now. and of all the weird things i've got a smoke smell in my nose here and there which started yesterday. joy. 6 months on and still strange stuff...but otherwise ok. have endoscopy on thursday and pretty nervous. it's not the endoscopy you've had lulu, it's the one that goes into the stomach. hopefully it will see what's going on as have had quite a bit of gi issues.school starts thursday \ud83e\udd73",
          "hi lulu,thank you for publishing the details of your meeting with your consultant. the news is promising especially there's nothing seriously wrong but having to wait for the inflammation to abate.have a lovely evening.",
          "hi lulu thank you for updating what he said could be in for a little longer haul than we thought it caught up with me today i've had to double my doses of hemp oil to get the tension back down i had a long hard shift today am hoping to be ok in the morning had a broken rail on the main line so had to do a bit of work \ud83d\ude2d taking the mickey out of me making me work \ud83d\ude02 i think you will be ok without the meds and actually feel better i've kept some flarin and will continue to take the vitamins if i get a headache or tension i take hemp oil the stronger version it seems to help not that i'm sure maybe none of it does and it is just time i'm hoping we all feel great soon gary",
          "thanks so much for sharing that interesting and useful advice, lulu. it's good to know that it's ok for these symptoms to come and go and it's nothing to worry about. it's also reassuring to know that the cause is inflammation which is gradually improving.of course as soon as i said my nose was clearer it started blocking again and giving myself a high score was a mistake as i feel a bit run down this week with cold symptoms.i'm tempted to get some of that sinus wash lulu, although i'm still steaming and using saline spray a couple of times a dayhave a good day everyone",
          "hi dane and everyonedefinitely interesting what he said about symptoms coming and going and he was very certain it was a positive sign! sorry to hear about the stomach issues and didn't you or someone else maybe have the smoke smell right at the start of this? i had it for a couple of days months ago and remember thinking oh here we go another symptom but it went away thank god it must make you feel really nauseous.good luck for thursday dane, it is nerve wracking but will be good to be checked out thoroughly.also good to get the kids back at school will give you some time for yourself - heard presenter on the radio this morning saying how probably all the mum's and dad's were desperate for the kids to go back to school and are now missing them terribly - i did think to myself ermm.. i don't reckon they are after having them around 24/7 for six months, they are probably just breathing a big sigh of relief and sitting doing nothing much for a while enjoying the peace and quiet!!take care, let us know how you get on tomorrow.lx",
          "yes how dare they expect us to do any work?!! - i was a bit indignant the first time someone asked me to do anything challenging but i think maybe we have lost our confidence a bit over last few months and also must be so hard to have a physical job as you are just not sure what your limits are at the moment. sorry it was a hard day but you got through it and let us know how you are feeling today - hoping you have bounced back after a decent night's sleep. have stopped the meds and am just going to not think about it too much and see how things go. i'll take a dose of flarin if i get a sore throat.lx",
          "it is always the same jo, as soon as you think something is better it comes back to bite you. i was the same monday night just sitting minding my own business and literally felt like i had the worst head cold and then by yesterday lunchtime it had gone again - really hope same for you that it doesnt last. i have not tried the sinus wash yet, my partner said it is disgusting he has used it, so not exactly encouraging but will give it a go and let you know. specialist told me last time to use it and i didn't bother so no point keep going back to him if i don't try what he suggests - although i did wonder if he had shares in neilmed as he seemed to have an awful lot of leaflets lying around on his desk!!lx",
          "no problem jim, think we need to share as much info as we can. how are things with you, any improvements?lx",
          "hi lulu good afternoon i'm having a better day today not so busy and just got off the phone with the ent specialist told her basically feeling better but the headaches and earaches and tension hasn't gone tight chest is still there and little stabbing pain in the back now and again told her i done the physio exercises for a few weeks but not working told her i feel better in myself but i am concerned that the symptoms are still there she is going to speak to my gp good luck with that i will like you just get on with it gary",
          "glad you are feeling better today gart and not so busy! - yep good luck with the gp feel lucky if the phone gets picked up at our surgery these days. specialist last night said just get on with your life and i do remember he did say even though none of us think we are particularly anxious the whole world is anxious at the moment which is probably true and we must have an underlying health anxiety from being so ill will so little support which may not be helping our recovery but not sure what we can do about that other than get plenty of rest and try not to worry - easier said than done though!enjoy your evening,lx",
          "gart?!! must read what i type before hitting post!",
          "hi lulu,thank you for asking how i am.much the same, the usual intermittent nasal congestion and drip. sporadic sore throat and mucus i think on my chest but i'm not sure about the last. my pal can see a change in me over the past few weeks regarding how i look and the fatigue. one thing i've noticed is i recover quicker from a dip now. that could be either me realising a dip is coming, so i stop what i'm doing or i've a greater resillience. who knows!definitely feel better than i have.your sounding good lulu.",
          "hi lulu, and hi to gary and dane too. nice to hear from all of you.thanks for your update lulu. its very interesting and i appreciate you taking the time to let us all know.i always thought that the coming and going of symptoms was a bad thing and reminiscent of a sort of post viral syndrome (which i dread) so it's interesting to hear this different viewpoint. i've been feeling pretty down and desperate about that lately so your news is very welcome. the neilmed thing is great fun if you don't mind feeling drowned in salty water! \ud83d\ude04i have used them in the past. after a couple of times it's fine. well i found it okay and i remember you commenting that salty water was something you didn't mind too much. it's a more powerful version of the sterimar spray i guess.i had a better sleep last night. the previous night was one hour in total \ud83d\ude32i've been finding it very hard to relax at night even if i'm exhausted. i took a bromezepam pill which a friend gave me. she uses it for flight anxiety. i gave it a try and slept like a baby. removed a lot of tension from me. i'd sure like a supply but it might not be easy getting a doc to give me such powerful stuff. i've realised there's a lot of background tension going on behind the scenes in my body. hard to recognise it's there as it is a constant companion i think, and not something i can try to alleviate with breathing or thought exercises either. it's like the body is on high alert. anyway, it certainly doesn't help and probably makes everything feel worse.chest and cough are still here today and low level headache. feel pretty run down. as far as the headaches are concerned, a bad glasses prescription from the optician didn't help, but the eye blurring previous to that and headaches were mostly virus based i think as my actual prescription has hardly changed and my eyes are in good shape. the optician said long term illness can affect the vision sometimes. i have seen flarin mentioned a lot, is that liquid based? and is it easily available? what are people's experiences of it on here?joanne - i wrote that my lumpy throat and nasal congestion was better yesterday and today its back, so.... i know how you feel. it's weird isn't it?! \ud83d\ude32 say nothing positive about symptoms seems to be the tactic! dane good luck with your endoscopy. i know how nerve wracking those invasive things can be. i had one at the 'other end' last year. but it was fine. i'm sure you'll be well looked after. anyway, thanks again lulu. and all the very best to everyone. good health and good wishes to all. stuart.",
          "hi jim,interesting what you say about 'the dip' and recognising it when it's coming. that's the trick i think. i don't think i've figured that yet. but your post has made me remember a few days ago i went on a walk and went too far, with not enough food /fuel inside me. i got home totally exhausted so i'm now realising it's no surprise i've had a relapse. it seems that energy management is key. thanks for jogging my memory! \ud83d\ude03",
          "hi stuart,been put in contact this afternoon with a chap who has me by a close pal.we spoke for an hour or so and his one underlying piece of advice is to time how long you do specific physical actions. for example-gardening, 20 minutes then an hour or two sitting down reading or watching tv and then repeat. he says that way you don't end up with exhaustion.he started with an ear infection three years ago, which lead to the post viral fatigue. he explained how it suddenly came on and how he had a real struggle for doctors to recognise it. he can do more than 20 minute bits of jobs now but had to work up to it slowly.",
          "poor chap, that sounds terrible. i hope it isn't us. did his symptoms match ours at all? good advice though concerning the timing of exercise.",
          "my thoughts exactly but there were no similar or the same symptoms.just an ear infection started it off.he's in a group of sufferers all with differing originating illnesses, lengths and severity of suffering.said he knew a couple of people that just woke up better on morning.bizzare.like you say good advice on effort expenditure.",
          "that's really good news jim and sometimes people close to us can see the improvements more than we can. i agree about seeing the dips coming now i think we probably recognise the change in symptoms and take a rest from what we are doing which helps. take care and hope things continue to improve.lx",
          "hi stuartthat sums it up perfectly being on high alert! i feel exactly the same and am aware of every pain or twinge in my body - it must cause anxiety and also be exhausting to have been like this for 6 months.i might save the neilmed experience for another day - you haven't sold the experience to me! even though i do love swimming in sea don't fancy squirting salt water up my nose!! flarin is just a lipid form of ibruprofen - still capsule form but easier on the stomach apparently - it works fast and gives good pain relief. i do wonder if we had taken ibruprofen from the start it might have helped with the inflammation but back in march we were being told not to take it but to only use paracetamol.i think sleep makes such a difference i only started feeling better when my sleep improved - you can buy nitol otc - would that help you maybe? stress also affects eyesight badly so probably combination of the virus/stress and prescription all affecting eyesight but hoping will improve now you've sorted prescription.agree, don't ever mention to anyone that you feel better or a symptom has gone as it is the surest way to set yourself up for a crash!! take care, keep in touch with how you are doing.lx",
          "afternoon all,i've been reading various reports on the internet about chronic fatigue syndrome.one via the nhs is aimed at clinicians and goes through a whole host of symptoms and the varying treatments/drugs for them. having read in the report in it's entirety all the symptoms listed are those of our happy cohort. i know across the forum we vary in symptoms but the report lists them all.apparently, there isn't any know drug to assist with the fatigue.have a google when you've a minute.hope everyone is okay today.",
          "afternoon everyone i've nearly done another week at work with a few symptoms i've been taking hemp oil and mullein leaf oil with me to work it may help may not but when i overdone it the other day i took it and rested should have an easy one tomorrow tight chest came when i got home i don't know when the gp will ring don't worry about that now i think we all now got to the stage where we will have to wait for that day when we can go great everythings gone then wait another week just in case just hope you all have a symptoms free weekend someone has to get there soon please gary",
          "totally agree with you gary.well done completing another week pal.",
          "thanks jim days are easier than nights except tuesday but sometimes it is going to test me i'm really lucky though like you and steph i haven't fainted yet all the tension came back and i felt my hands and legs all tingly same thing happened when i over done it riding my bike so we have to just judge it i've got a holiday after 4 nights next week jim so i'm looking forward to taking it easy you have a great weekend mate and don't push it gary",
          "yep bring on friday! how long does the tight chest last for? my chest started feeling tight last night and isn't right today but not too bad. do you have to cough to clear it or does it just ease up on its own. i am feeling bit nervous as stopped the mucodyne and am worried the mucus will now collect on chest.my son said today the tube is packed again so people heading back to work but no chance of any social distancing going on - just waiting for my team to be summoned back to office, think large corporations are getting a lot of pressure from government to get back into offices.enjoy your evening.lx",
          "hi lulu yes it's weird because i get the tight chest and it comes up to my throat for a while then goes and come back i've not had the mucus as bad that maybe because i get the tension headaches and earaches i was told when the mucus comes up to spit it out not so easy at work the trains are getting busier because i go through watford junction car park on my way to work and there is a lot more cars in there than a couple of weeks ago so i imagine that will be the case for the next few weeks gary",
          "morning everyone,it's a strange morning, feel really out of sorts.just as though i've a head cold but my nose blocks and unblocks with bizarre regularity with a burning sensation in my nostrils. feel uncommonly cold too. i've managed to get up some mucus though.even my stomach has joined in, churning away, feeling an acidic burn. i won't mention what's taking place further down.hope everyone is feeling okay.jim.",
          "hi jimsorry you're not well, i've had a bit of a week like that, feeling run down with cold symptoms, sore eyes, nose blocking, sore stomach etc. i think it must be from overdoing it at the wkend, i don't learn, and did far too much.hope it eases off for you soonit's a tricky one, the tight chest, lulu, it comes and goes, sometimes can clear it, sometimes not. i know what you mean about giving up medication, especially after so long, it's scary! i forgot to take one of my reflux capsules yesterday, and i survived :)hope your eye problems improve, stuart, mine have been really sore this last week. i tried wearing my contact lenses for a few hours at the wkend as they seemed better, but now they're sore againhope all went ok for you dane, at your appt, and you're feeling betterhave a good day everyone :)",
          "hi jimi had this exact thing last week - it did pass after a couple of days. had a few stomach issues but not as bad as you by sound of things but the head cold literally came on whilst sitting watching tv and then passed the next day. if you google non-allergic rhinitis that is what the specialist has put on follow up letter i received today. basically inflammation and swelling of the mucous membranes of nose and you get runny nose and stuffiness - sounds same for you and others who have had the head cold feeling on and off. he said to drink more water i sometimes don't drink enough - felt a bit ropey yesterday but better today - just no rhyme nor reason why only difference was i slept really well last night so maybe that helped.take care, let us know how you are feeling tomorrow.lx",
          "hi jothe tight chest is the thing that freaks me out the most - i had it night before last and couldn't sleep in case it got worse but in fact was better in the morning - i find walking each day helps but if i walk too far it makes it worse, it's a balancing act. i am trying not to worry about not taking medication and actually feel ok today so fingers crossed! doc seemed chilled about it and just said you can always start taking again if need to.we must try not to overdo it this weekend, but easier said than done!hope you got on ok dane yesterday and things are better for you.have a great weekend, everyone.lx",
          "sounds like you've been through the mill again jim how you feeling today looks like a nice day here up early can't sleep gary",
          "morning lulu tight chest again this morning feeling like just gotta go with it now i'm just taking mullein leaf and vitamins added zinc now just in case for the immune system play the waiting game don't think i will here anything from the gp for a while i've only got four nights next week then off for a while wishing it will be over by the time i go back to work somehow not so sure who knows maybe it will gary",
          "morning gary,thank you and everyone else for their kind words.this morning i feel better but with a bit of nasal congestion.as down in your neck of the woods gary the sun is out, so looks as though it'll be a nice day. it's a bit cold but an extra layer will sort that.glad you've a short week gary. i'm sure you'll have no problems and then your off!",
          "your right i should be fine with work now jim i was wondering before about the fatigue it seems like i got close to pushing it then rested just sitting here typing this and noticed my stomach is going mad weird noises ive been getting that a few times lately my daughter told me the other day hope that's normal and just goes good to see you feeling better today jim i'm going to be a devil have a few beers later see if i feel ok tomorrow hopefully everyone else has a good weekend gary",
          "glad you are feeling better jim, i think maybe the change of temperature etc. that causes the nasal congestion but hopefully it improves, i've been the same this morning but was fine yesterday!enjoy your beers later gary and have a good weekend everyone.lx",
          "thanks lulu.i've neilmed my nose twice today. first time was the best. ages after i'd done it i bent down to pick something up and water poured from my nose. bloody hysterical.my test today has been cutting the front lawn.",
          "hi joanne and everyone, thanks for the words about my eyes. i have my new prescription now and i think they're okay. my eyes haven't changed much so i think the post viral stuff is the culprit. i told the optician about my eye problems and i was given some drops for them. they're for dry, sore eyes. very good so far, they're called 'thealoz duo'. not sure how widely available they are but might be worth trying joanne. i was given a free sample so it's worth asking for one maybe. i didn't post for a couple of days as i called my new doctor's surgery, hoping for a fresh new start. unfortunately, by all accounts i got the worst doctor at the place and he was so disinterested and unhelpful it drove me to the upper reaches of stress. i had a whole list of things to ask and got nowhere. i could have cried. anyway i couldn't talk about it for a couple of days as i needed to forget about it. my main symptoms at the moment are the tightness in the chest, a feeling of having restricted breathing, and general unwellness similar to the grotty feeling you get with a cold. i have the need to cough to try and shift the feeling of heavy mucus on chest but i see very little. i even wonder if it is coming from my throat instead. as mentioned at an earlier post i find the tight/breathy feeling comes on stronger after i eat in conjunction with nasal congestion. can't understand it.the other weird thing is that if i have a drink of say rum or bourbon whatever, in the evening (straight) all my symptoms disappear. chest, cough, congestion - i suddenly feel normal. i can't figure it out and it says to me that being relaxed and sedated a little have a big effect. lulu i mentioned high alert to you, that feeling that my body is operating in an emergency state and i am starting to think we need our bodies to be told to 'stand down'. don't know how but i really think its the key. i can't figure out how a glass of rum magically removes a tight chest that i've had all day and the lump in my throat etc. weird! anyway enough of my musings. i hope you're all doing better today and that tomorrow brings positivity. all the best to everyone.",
          "thanks for the eye advice, stuart, i've been using celluvisc eye drops for dry eyes for a while and they're not helping at all with the sore eyes. i think maybe i need to get some different ones, i'll have a look for those. that's good your eyes are better, i'm not sure about my prescription, glasses seem ok, bit blurry, but my eyes are different when i'm wearing contact lenses, so will have to wait and see.sorry you had the doctor from hell! haven't spoken to mine for a while, they're really not interested at my surgery. i think we're doing a better job sorting it out for ourselves.i've been reading about post-viral fatigue, and i'm sure that's what i have now as all those cold symptoms seem to be part of it. (trying not to read too much stuff now though) anyway decided to order some co enzyme q10 which is supposed to help with energy levels and the immune system. and i wasn't going to order anything else...well this is definitely the last??hope you're feeling better and enjoy your glass of rum! sounds like the best medicineenjoy your evening everyone :)",
          "hi jo and everyone,haven't spoken to my doc in a while either, a couple of times when i've been feeling particularly out of sorts i thought to pick up the phone for help but then decided...nah, what she going to say already...i just pray whatever problem i'm having will go on its own. anyway i've got some further testing going on now so that's helpful.had the endoscopy on thursday. was a bag of nerves before it, couldn't sleep properly the night before. just to help me calm down the nurse asks me right before if i've ever had it before, i told her no and she says, it's not very comfortable but it will be over quick. gee, thanks for the tip! same nurse couldn't get a canula in my hand she kept saying my veins were collapsing. i was getting so anxious! eventually she got it in my arm and once the sedation went in it was ok. no picnic but thankfully it was over quick. i've never been sedated before but have to say it felt awesome to be so relaxed (it lingers on post procedure) stuart you were saying our bodies are on high alert and we need to calm them down, i think we all need a shot of this stuff \ud83d\ude01my throats sore now from the endoscopy, hopefully that will ease up soon.results so far are non erosive gastritis which is inflammation in the lining of the stomach and waiting for further results from pathology which can take up to 6 weeks! not been told if i need treatment for the gastritis so carrying on as usual.jim sorry to hear about the tummy troubles, sounds similar to what i had 2 weeks ago, no idea what provoked it. hope you're feeling better now.for those that mentioned eye issues, mine still sting at random moments, i wonder when that will go though doesn't bother me too much.hope you're all ok and are able to enjoy the rest of the weekend.",
          "hi joanne, thanks for the reply. i did enjoy my glass or two of rum last night and thankfully the tight chest and other symptoms left me again. the symptoms are back this morning. unfortunately i can't drink rum all day \ud83d\ude02 on the subject of eyes, the optician told me that we tend to blink less these days as we're looking at screens so much more. the blinking lubricates the eye and as a consequence of not doing it so much we can get very dry eyes without realising. i'm not saying that is what causing any of your problems but i thought it was a useful piece of information to keep in mind. as soon as you mentioned coenzyme q10 i was straight on to the internet. is there any particular brand you were considering buying? i'll try anything if it might help! have a good day today. hope it's a better one. \u263a\ufe0f",
          "hi dane, well done with the endoscopy. it must be a relief to get it over with. i had a colonoscopy last year and was very nervous beforehand. it took three nurses to manage to get a canula in properly as i was so dehydrated and anxious by the previous 36 hours of preparation for the procedure, so i know how you must have felt. i'll be interested to hear what treatment you receive for the gastritis. the sedative i had was great too. as you say - if only we could have a few days of that to give our bodies a chance to rest. i'm sure it would help. hope your sore throat settles down quickly and you have a good week. \ud83d\ude42",
          "hi stuart and everyonei am the same as soon as i drink alcohol all my symptoms seem to disappear \ud83d\ude02 in the early days i used to have a glass of wine every night and for an hour or so after would feel so much better - i suppose alcohol suppresses the senses so probably similar effect as taking ibruprofen you get some relief but unfortunately doesn't last long! i think quite a bit of the mucus is now in my throat and nose, the ent guy could see it when he did the endoscopy but i do still get mucus on chest but i think better than it was a few weeks ago.still not used the neilmed jim, probably should as my nose is blocked and have the head cold feeling again today but am just enjoying no meds or procedures at the moment after so long, will leave it a few days and see if it resolves on its own. glad you got on ok dane and the procedure went as well as it could, it must have been stressful for you - it's amazing that we all seem to still have inflammation in different areas of our bodies - god knows what was going on 6 months ago if the inflammation is still there now?! hopefully it will gradually resolve or you can be given some treatment to help.i am same jo and am not going down the post viral fatigue route, i believe the mind is powerful and so easy to read stuff and immediately project it onto your symptoms - i am just telling myself that at 6 months i feel so much better than at 3 months so hopefully by 9 months/1 year all these issues will resolve - i have to believe that otherwise it is too depressing. seems we are all progressing but in a two steps forward and one back kind of direction!!enjoy the rest of the day everyone!lx",
          "hi lulu,i've taken to the drink and after an antidepressant tablet, sleep like a log.the neilmed thingy is okay but i get alot of water trapped, which lasts a while.i'm the same as you with the mucus. definitely more nasal but a bit in the chest.my challenge is the fatigue. i tried cutting the rear lawn. no chance. i'll improve, i've got to. i can't, won't stay like this. everything else i could live with.we will get there!dane,my stomach has improved thank you and well done for braving through that procedure. not nice. a couple of years ago i had a camera up the other end. lovely!they could get a vein, so it was gas and air. lol.hope everyone is well.",
          "you will definitely improve jim, wasn't too long ago when we were all in a bad place and things have improved a lot over the last couple of months. i need to do the neilmed wash the consultant was adamant that is what would help me most with the nasal stuff - i suppose it shows it is not that bad that i haven't done it! i do get very tired too but many of my friends have said they feel tired after lockdown - all got used to a slower way of life but i know this is a different type of tiredness from being ill but again i do think it will slowly improve. back in may/june i literally couldn't get off the sofa to cook a meal or anything - looking back helps me see the improvements.all these procedures, if someone had said someone was going to stick a camera up my nose and down back of throat six months ago i would have freaked out but now i just don't care so long as it is a means to an end to get us back to full health they can do whatever they like! take care,lx",
          "thanks, stuart, that's interesting info about eyes, i think looking at screens isn't helping my eyes, i'll have to try to rest them more.i've ordered nutravita coenzymeq10 from amazon, i looked at the reviews and liked the sound of it. hope it helps!lulu, i agree with you, i don't want to be post-viral, i just want it to go away and not come back. let me know if you try neilmed, maybe i'll give my nose a blast!dane well done for surviving that ordeal, hope they'll be able to advise you now, and things improve for you",
          "thanks jo, jim, lulu, stuartguess it's a bit unpleasant whichever 'end' it goes through!consultant who referred me for the test didn't think they'd find anything and that kept me thinking. ..well then why am i doing this? glad to have done it as it's properly diagnostic.throat very sore but otherwise ok (fatigue but nothing out the ordinary!)",
          "morning everyone!have a face to face with respiratory guy weds eve if anyone has any additional questions. saw on sky news last night that the telegraph running article that the lungs will heal in 3 months even after severe covid - ent guy told me they had made progress researching the effects on lungs and to speak to specialist weds so maybe this is what he was referring to . it may not be 3 months for some of us but overall positive news. hope everyone has a good day.lx",
          "morning lulu,thank you for the information.would you please do your usual and disseminate your conversation with the consultant.if i think of any questions i'll let you know.thanks lulu your a star.hope everyone is well.jim.",
          "hi lulu and everyone.lulu thanks for letting us know about your face to face appt. could you please ask the specialist about breathlessness occurring after eating? this is a common occurrence for me, within 30 minutes of food i'm feeling short of breath and congested, with post nasal drip and lump in throat, doesn't matter what food it is . i'm now using my inhaler to try and stop it as it is quite an uncomfortable feeling and think it might be asthma related. any info would be great. i agree with you about not getting into the mindset about post viral syndromes. it is best to remain positive. we will get better. the only thing that bothers me is that i'm not as good as i was weeks ago. i was walking twice as far and faster. now i'm slower and not able to walk as far without repercussions. last night i had a 20 minute walk which left me with chest pain and an increase in mucus, congestion and fatigue. wish i could understand what the hell is going on. it doesn't make sense. two glasses of rum came to my rescue though!!! at the end of all this crap i might be finally cured but in the meantime become a raging alcoholic instead! \ud83d\ude02 joanne thank you for the info on the coenzyme q10. i'm going to buy some \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4dhope you all have better days to come. cheers! ps has anyone seen a specialist via nhs yet or are all the appointments so far through private?",
          "hi stuart, sure of course will ask that question. i do find that when i do a long hilly walk i seem to get more mucus and congestion than if i don't walk so far but i tend to think that is a good thing (i am going to ask about this too) as i think from what i've read it is very hard for the body to clear the mucus from the lungs that is why the recovery period is so long and the exercise loosens it. i'd have no hesitation hitting the rum if it does the trick!! - do you drink plenty of fluids during the day - i find the best is peppermint tea it makes a real difference.anyway, stay positive it will improve and i'll give you a full update when i've seen the specialist.as you know, i gave up on the nhs around week 6 and all my appointments are now private - my surgery was really good at issuing sick notes and repeat prescriptions but if you needed any medical advice or help forget it - i was better off googling it \ud83d\ude44 shocking really that we have had so little support. i know there are a lot of #longcovid groups pushing for recognition and help many led by health professionals who are still struggling like many of us six months on - i follow a few on twitter and there are a lot of sick, worried people all trying to get answers but still no recognition by the government - it probably doesn't suit their agenda of getting people back to work for people to know if you get ill you can be sick for months even if you are fit and young - people still believe it is mild flu symptoms which i spose for some it is but for many it is not.lx",
          "that's really good news lulu thanks you for the update had a few drinks the weekend thought i would try what stuart said and it gave me a good sleep both nights but came back and bit me on the back side so to speak chilled most of the day though and back to work tonight you really have made my day with the news wasn't too sure about the breathing hope everyone is getting better gary",
          "hi stuart,the care i'm getting now is only nhs, had the endoscopy from a referral and have a face to face appt with respiratory specialist on the 22nd. after whinging and whining to my gp for weeks she eventually got me referred to the post covid team at barnet hospital. it's all veeerrryyy slow but at least it's something. i think there are quite a few post covid clinics around now might be worth telling your gp to refer you.",
          "thanks for the positive words lulu and i very much appreciate you asking the specialist for me, very kind of you. have a nice evening \u263a\ufe0f",
          "hi gary, sorry you got bitten. i only have a couple of glasses... or sometime three. glad you slept well though! have a good evening.",
          "thanks stuart sometimes i get a bit carried away peroni goes down so well and when you get chatting forget how many i have and at the time i forget about my symptoms i'm on nights now so recovering in both respects hope you continue to improve gary",
          "hi dane, thanks for your reply. i asked my new doc about being referred to a post covid clinic and he said he hadn't heard of such things! he was totally useless. now i am confused as to why he doesn't know. it's great you're finally getting some care. i am still waiting since may to see a respiratory specialist. have you actually visited a post covid clinic now or still waiting? out of interest, did you ever test positive for the virus?",
          "hi gary, beer doesn't seem to help me at all, although i love the stuff. it tends to make more mucus for me, or so it seems. i don't get the same medicinal effects as rum etc. i think the warmth helps a lot (and strength \ud83d\ude02) hope work goes okay, you're doing a great job gary. amazing. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f",
          "thanks stuart but to be honest i have a good job that i can take it easy if i feel the need to that mucus will ease soon for you enjoy your week gary",
          "that's annoying.whereabouts are you? you can maybe try find out yourself online if any of the local hospitals have anything. i remember years ago wanting to get a certain test done and when i asked my then gp to arrange he had no idea what i was talking about and proceeded to google it for ages and still couldn't find it. i ended up going home, googling it myself and ordering it! that was a lesson for me that sometimes have to be a bit proactive with my healthcare, it's annoying but it is what it is.haven't visited the clinic yet, only had a chat (a very long one) with a respiratory specialist over the phone.i've only tested positive for antibodies, got the virus before the lockdown when they weren't swabbing unless admitted.have you got an appointment for a specialist?",
          "hi everyone hope you're all doing ok. i contacted my gp last week and she prescribed me otrivine it's a nasal spray. she said it would help with the congestion. lulu thanks for telling us about neilmed like jim i've been using it and if you don't mind the feeling of drowning lol it helps clear the congestion too. there's not much change with me still waiting for a miracle !!",
          "morning guys,there are a couple of articles on long covid on the bbc and daily mail websites.they are running duplicate articles, so take your pick on which you read. the bbc one is more comprehensive though.",
          "hi dane, i tried googling for post covid clinics but i don't get anything. i'm in west sussex. really annoys me that there seems to be no care and no service in place. i feel pretty left out of the loop really. i was referred to a respiratory specialist back in may i think. no news. if gps got back to doing their jobs properly and at least did the basic respiratory tests for asthma etc it would be a help. anyway thanks for responding, i hope you get seen soon. cheers \ud83d\ude42",
          "hi steph, i'm waiting for that miracle too, hope it comes soon!seems to be all in the nose, throat eyes, ears. thanks for info on lungs, lulu, i wonder how we know when they have fully recovered? i'm never sure if soreness is back or lungs. it's hard to tell.good luck with q10 stuart, i've started on mine today, hoping for more energy!well done on the nights, gary, i don't think i'd survive that, i'm rubbish in the eveninghave a good day everyone :)",
          "hi joanne, good luck with the q10. i have to be honest i hadn't noticed the price and when i saw it i realised i can't afford it (embarrassingly) as i'm not working and self employed. i need to know it works before spending even more money. i'd be very interested to hear how you get on with it though as that would convince me. hope you have a nice evening. \u263a\ufe0f",
          "hi lulu,i hope everything has gone well with your appointment.jim.",
          "hey stuart,that is annoying. if you haven't completely despaired i would suggest you keep nudging the gp to help you out on the odd chance they actually do something eventually.hope you're improving in the meantime.new restriction news feels a little harsh. as a family of 6 that means we can't socialise with anyone not even my sister and family! i think it's important to take the extra caution now especially as winter approaches, on the other hand...yikes!i've been doing ok, sore throat is settling down. have the odd muscle aches and bit of reflux but mostly managing.how are you all doing?",
          "hi jim and everyone!had a long consultation last night - really nice, helpful, reassuring guy who has had c19 so very understanding. these are the points which hopefully will reassure people.exercise/walking - definitely do as much as you can and set goals to gradually increase. helps strengthen lungs and also helps with mucus clearance. for me he thinks the mucus is more in the back of the throat and could see signs of reflux from scan so told me to keep taking the lansoprazole for time being. chest pains /pain in shoulders/back- every tissue in body is affected by c19 including muscles and joints which will cause the aching but this will subside with time. fire/burning sensation on inhalation is not the lungs it is inflammation of the chest wall and will improve. pains in the back, shoulders etc. is the body repairing itself. these will come and go and gradually improve.ct scan - mine showed a small patch of pneumonia damage on right lung but will heal and overall lungs look good. many people's ct scans/xrays are clear but they still have ongoing symptoms. he said sometimes the changes to organs are microscopic and won't shown on scans but will still cause you to have symptoms. just need the body to heal and recover which takes time.more breathless after eating - he said this is because the stomach distends after eating making the lungs smaller and giving the feeling of breathlessness. this will resolve. try and eat smaller meals more often.will lungs fully recover - yes with time may take up to a year.fatigue, depression, sleep disorders - have seen this in many patients. important to rest, pace yourself, stick with sleep routine and stay positive, things will improve but do think these symptoms are actually caused by virus - it is not in our minds!reinfection - believes antibodies lasts for up to 3 months but t cell memory should protect you from another infection for much longer unless you are exposed to a massive load of the virus so shouldn't consider yourself immune and still take every precaution (pretty sure we will all do that anyway!!)asthma - is seeing many people now showing signs of asthma after being infected with c19 - he thinks i am showing these signs and although never had before it can be triggered by a virus - will know more in 3 months when i see him how i've progressed. he said cough, chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of breath are all asthma symptoms - you can have 1 or 2 of these symptoms or all 4. only time will tell!tinnitus - for me thinks linked to the ent issues.had a lung function test which came out above average.anyway, hope this helps everyone and as usual just a reminder this consultation was relevant to me and my symptoms! (apart from the eating one!)hope everyone is doing well.lx",
          "thank you very much lulu. yet again you've done our little cohort proud.great news you'll fully repair!sounds as though we'll all have to be patient.",
          "hi lulu and everyone, echo jim in that you've done us proud reassuring us that we will hopefully all get better in time. i've not felt well with an ear ache and slight temp on and off which started with a headache yesterday. just so fed up with feeling off it's been too long now !! take care everyone and thanks again lulu xx",
          "hooe you feel better soon steph.",
          "i really hope we all fully repair jim its been such a long hard slog and still never know how going to feel one day to next. we just have to believe that things will continue to improve.lx",
          "definitely lulu.sue's doing well. back to normal.",
          "oh really that is very good news!! was wondering how she was getting on. so no symptoms at all? lx",
          "lulu,her message is on page 74.shes back to normal other than an odd day of feeling tired.",
          "hi stephthat is it .. just so fed up not feeling well and not knowing what's coming next. i felt rough monday sore throat etc, , pretty good yesterday, bit chesty and coughy today!! maybe we over think it but you know when you dont feel right dont you? take care, you seem to have had a rough couple of weeks you must be due a good patch! i really hope so.lx",
          "thanks jim , how's you doing ? hope you're feeling ok",
          "yes shame our bodies aren't see through then we might be able to see exactly what's happened and what's going on lool . i went for a walk earlier and it bought back memories of when i was trying to get back to fitness and even a little walk was hard going !! thank god we're all seeing improvements despite little set backs. things can only get better !!",
          "thanks lulu it really puts our minds at rest! i'm so scared that i'll get it again and dredding the winter. going to have a flu jab on 19th, work want me to start doing the sleep ins again now so will see how i cope as on your own with 5 clients all night \ud83d\ude0f",
          "hi jim how r u getting on now.",
          "hi gary how r you doing now.",
          "thanks so much for sharing that information with us, lulu. it's really reassuring to know that it is a matter of time before we make full recovery. even though that is what we keep telling ourselves, it helps that a specialist is saying it too.yes i wish i knew what was going on inside too, steph, just lots of healing hopefully.stuart, i don't blame you not buying those capsules. i wish i hadn't, they were so expensive, but i was feeling really low on energy and they sounded like the answer. i've only taken one so far and it gave me energy but took a while to unwind as they're so strong. maybe i'll take one a month!all the best everyone, we'll get there:)",
          "me too am very nervous. specialist recommended both the flu jab and the pneumonia one - i dont normally have either but think we need to be extra careful this winter.good luck with the nights, keep in touch.lx",

          "i don't think i'll rush to get any jabs atm as i don't feel fully recovered from this yet. i've heard the pneumonia one is good though and you don't need to get it every year lulu. today i feel like i've got a cold nose really blocked and eyes watery, but ear ache better !! wishing everyone a nice weekend , think the sun's going to be out !!",

          "i'm similar steph. i feel as though i've a head cold. absolutely sick to the back teeth of it all.as for lulu's kind suggestion of volunteering either gary or me i'll bow out on that one. oh this will make you laugh. i was given a respiratory physiotherapy appointment for the 21st of september way back in june. today i received a letter cancelling it due to covid.you couldn't write it.the nhs have totally let us down.",
          "thanks lulu i'm hoping a g&t or two will help xx",

          "morning guys and girls just catching up with you i have never had the jabs either before covid i only ever had a back spasm so like most of you how would it affect me and my gps bless them have not even bothered phoning yet as for me i'm off work for a few days now you will be pleased to know all the tension has eased i only get a little ear tension left one tight chest has also eased i still get a little stabs in the back now and again time will see us through have a good weekend gary",
          "nice one gary.you're nearly there.",
          "hi jim how are you doing mate do you still think christmas or you feeling bit better in yourself i'm still getting mucus but it is nothing to what you get i've been up town with my boy this morning little tight chest now but and left ear tension otherwise feeling fine i really don't think my gp will ring now and to tell you the truth i don't care its not right this day and age that you and others can't get the help you need if i felt like i did three months ago i would be bothered going to ride it out now try and have a good weekend gary",
          "hi lulu and everyone. i asked about getting the two jabs last week to the totally useless gp i spoke to (think i'd get more out of a stone lying on the ground.) he said hardly anything other than he didn't think so as it was for people with underlying conditions. i said that after 6 months don't you think i have an underlying condition???? anyway i got nowhere. so i am non the wiser but i agree with you about the apprehension. i'm scared of making things worse. i'm due an ecg next week as i spoke to another doc yesterday, who was almost human. one thing that is stressing me out now is that i'm not getting any money in as i'm self employed and it's a physical job. i have to face the reality that i have to apply for esa sick benefit, but it scares me getting involved with all that stuff. i will need a doctors note but that means having to speak to them again and making sure they understand and take seriously my condition. dreading it \ud83d\ude13hope everyone has a good day today. by the way jim, that's total crap about your appointment. utter joke. so sorry.",
          "hi everyone :)enjoy your time off gary, sounds like you're nearly there, that's great!i've got mostly cold symptoms, but at least they're more predictable, i know roughly what to expect each day, unless i overdo things. just getting fed up with it all. and we're having another lockdown here in the midlands :(i'm not keen on having jabs at the moment, will see how i feel in a month or sohope you can get some sick pay, stuart, it's a long time to go without earning, maybe ask that nice doctor. i know what you mean though, they make everything really difficult, but it'll be worth it. yes those q10 must be the same as having about 10 cups of coffee! the effects lasted a few days.jim, they get worse, cancelling your appt, they're totally useless!enjoy your weekends",
          "hi joanne yes i feel that six months is the marker like lulu said i've just about given up taking any medication i'm not even sure if it did work against covid or not maybe it was a time thing in the first place hopefully your cold symptoms go and your done with it soon have a good weekend gary",
          "hi stuart and everyonejust set aside a morning when you have plenty of time , take a few deep breaths, a large swig of rum and deal with the sick benefit application - you are entitled to it, you have been really ill so should claim it and hopefully it may ease the financial worry, i wonder if it can be back dated? maybe if the doctor queries how serious your condition is you could suggest having a quick read through of the 4,153 posts on this thread! i read that matt hancock (not personally!) was supposed to be updating gps on long covid but wouldn't be holding my breathe (even if i could!)sounds like everyone feels a bit apprehensive on the jab front - but good advice from jim to leave it for a bit longer see how we feel mid/end october. another six weeks will make a difference to how we feel.have a great weekend everyone, hope the cold symptoms have eased jim and steph and jo. sounds like you are doing well gary, we must be nearly at six months anniversary - we might have to readjust our expectation to christmas now to be completely back to our pre c19 baseline but hopefully we are on the home stretch now!lx",
          "evening all,i booked an appt for the flu vaccine because i received a text message that i'm entitled to one so just went and booked. didn't give a thought to possible after effects. never had one before. now you've got me thinking...felt a bit off on friday with slight breathlessness and muscle aches also new weird thing, i can sometimes 'feel' my ear drums going it's pretty strange. also been coughing a bit more and to make things more worrying, good friends of ours called to say they are displaying symptoms and are self isolating. they live on our street and we hang out with them regularly \ud83d\ude2c so spent the whole time worrying that maybe we need to get checked too and maybe my coughing is something new \ud83e\udd14 \ud83d\ude2c this is all great for the anxiety.that's the big news from my end. let's see if we can even book a test.",
          "hi danesorry for worrying you about the jabs am sure will be fine i just wondered what others were thinking as i don't normally have them.have your friends been tested? fingers crossed it is just a cold. i had my ears popping this morning and know gary has had a lot of ear issues too. i still have tinnitus so was hoping the popping would help but have still got it this evening! try not to worry as sure you will be fine and friday was just one of those rubbish days we are all still having.take care and let us know how you are.lx",
          "that's ok lulu, not worried about the jab just good to know what to expect so you can make an informed decision, appt anyway sometime in october so have time.so annoying all these little ailments like with the ears, you're grateful it's not the big stuff bothering you but it's enough to make you aware you're not back to normal yet.friends are struggling to book a test they might just go private.i'm trying not to worry but of course all i do is think about it all the time!",
          "hi dane yes lulu is right i have had the ear troubles it is the left one now still giving me tension now and again when i get tight chest but it's easing up and i'm hoping going soon it is annoying but it will go i'm really glad the head tension has gone most of the shoulder and neck tension has as well so if anyone is still getting it it will go eventually gary",
          "hi lulu yes your right six months next week what a roller-coaster ride that was can someone stop it now i want to get off i'm hoping the tight chest goes soon then i will start trying to get back to full fitness again with a few beers thrown in i'm doing everything that i can normally and not bothered by it now just taking zinc for the immune system now when i have to go back to work i will be on seven nights so if i get through that then i know i'm close to recovery gary",
          "hey lulu thanks for your advice, i'll have the rum on standby. i shouldn't have to be worried about the doctor not complying with my wishes for a sick note but they've been so useless i can't help but think it. how is everyone doing today? i'm very chesty and coughing quite a lot. it seems to have got worse these last couple of weeks. like i have a repeating chest cold with none of the gunk that one would normally expect. lulu i'm guessing it was 24 weeks last friday or have i lost track? one thing i'd like to suggest - and lulu you made me think of it, with your suggestion about telling the doc about the amount of posts on here, is can we move to the last page (74) ? i think if anyone new comes here they don't know we are all here posting a few pages earlier so they don't get any support and if for instance a doctor or researcher came here and saw the final page it looks pretty inactive, and we will be invisible to them. also, the page is lagging for me too so what do you think, can we move? just a suggestion. all the best everyone. stuart",
          "hi stuart and everyoneyes think it was stuart and you are on the same timescale as me and gary i believe. can't believe we are all still here with symptoms although i have to say i am on the surface much better and pretty much leading a normal life but i know my chest and breathing is still not right. had to wear a mask for few hours today and now chest is tight. sorry to hear you have been chesty and coughing again stuart - have you tried lansoprazole - ive lost track who has taken what - i stopped it last week and noticed a real difference had a sore throat again and was coughing more from the mucus in throat. sure, let's move pages it definitely makes sense. shall we move tomorrow? over to gary to do the honours!! hope everyone finds us.enjoy the rest of the day.lx",
          "me too gary am contemplating going back to swimming in the next few weeks and build my fitness back up. it will be a good test to see how the seven nights at work go and from what you say sounds like you will be fine. does the tight chest just come and go or does it last for a while? i think this is what the specialist was saying to me could indicate me having developed asthma but i am not sure i spose we will just have to see if it resolves over time - that is why he wants to see me at christmas. have to say the tight chest freaks me out a lot, probably more than anything else now.if you post tomorrow can you move us on to the latest page?! we are lagging again \ud83d\ude02 take care,lx",
          "hi danei know it is pointless to say don't worry, i'd be exactly the same. agree i think we all know we are not yet back to normal - you always get a little reminder in some shape or form!just been in a restaurant which was well organised with socially distanced tables and some idiot sitting there on the table nearest us coughing and sneezing and not covering up - just want to cry why are people so stupid. why would you go out at the moment if you have a cold but it seems so many people just don't care. have come to the conclusion there are a lot of selfish people around.hope everything turns out well for your friends dane and tests are negative then you can stop worrying. take care,lx",
          "lulu,has your consultant prescribed you a steroid inhaler?",
          "hi lulu i saw your last message now can't find it so moved us to page 74 gary can everyone go to page 74 gary",
          "hi jimno he hasn't he said he wants to wait another 3 months to see whether things resolve or not so have a follow up appointment early december. he said if anything changes or gets worse to get in touch with him. i really don't want to start on inhalers unless it is absolutely necessary so am still hoping things will improve with time.lx",
          "ok so we have moved to page 74!",
          "hi i'm having my flu jab on sat so will be able to let you know how it goes. i've been feeling like i have a cold coming and phelm again it comes and goes, it's all a worry.",
          "i think it is def wise to have it susan and thanks for letting us know how you feel after. sorry you have the cold and phlegm symptoms again, it just never seems really to go away it always feels to me it is there lingering in the background waiting to raise its ugly head. i had cold symptoms start suddenly last night sneezed a few times, nose tingling and blocked, woke up this morning and it has gone but chest feels a bit tight today - i just give up trying to work it all out. do wonder though if it is to do with the temperature change? if so, we will be in for another blip when it turns colder again! the temperature is all over the place at the moment so probably not helping.hope work is going ok and the symptoms lift again soon.lx",
          "hi lulu i know i sometimes think it's to do with the weather i feel more sensitive to everything now which i neveruse to. we all will get there it's a time thing also new virus so we're all learning as we go along i did read that the t cells keep fighting this virus abs will reconize it if we get again?",

          "hi dane, i have had, and still do have the neck tension. especially at the top where it meets the skull. i also get a burning feeling in my joints sometimes especially when hit with the fatigue. as for ignorant people - i happened to post on a comment forum a few weeks ago where i noticed some people dismissing the virus as a government plot to control us all and that it didn't affect you if you're fit apart from a bit of flu for two weeks, you know the kind of thing. i commented about our situation and got a number of sarcastic dismissive replies. i'm sure you can imagine. it made me pretty mad. some people just don't want to listen.",
          "hi stuart i've got a feeling that the gps and hospitals knew that we were out there but because they didn't know what to expect or in what capacity they were told to send us home unless we couldn't breathe properly then maybe we would be looked at more seriously i remember a conversation i had with a young doctor who didn't have a clue as to what to do with me and said because i worked on the railway maybe i had a chest infection but he never checked the xray and gave me antibiotics now like you said there are lots more people like us and if there is a second wave they should know now who has it and what to do but i wouldn't put money on it \ud83d\ude02 gary",

          "that's great gary! finally some proper help. hooe the referral doesn't take too long.i've had all kids home since monday because 2 of them came down with sore throat. now the 2 have colds and thankfully don't need testing because don't have other symptoms. not that we could get a test if we needed, there aren't any to book, i checked. lively over here \ud83d\ude04 hopefully i can send some back to school tomorrow. have had pretty strong muscle aches in the meantime, it's the 2 steps forward, one step back feeling...",
          "hi dane yes i know what you mean about testing they haven't got any thing right from the beginning so they are not going to get it any better for a long time hopefully you can get them back to school they had one test positive in my boys school and then his brother was also positive but not their sister i was taking hemp oil when i was getting tension i think it was really good only used flarin when i got head tension but who knows what works hopefully your well into recovery now dane good luck with the kids gary",
          "hi gary everyonegood news you will get to see an ent specialist, you will probably have the endoscopy to look down throat - good to get it checked out, sure it must be healing by now but good to be reassured.sorry about the kids dane, your freedom was short lived!! it must be a nightmare for the school too as most kids have colds/runny noses this time of year, it is hardly surprising the testing centres can't cope but think will have to ramp it up as it is not going to get better any time soon.have felt pretty good today went up to town for lunch, train was fine everyone had masks and socially distanced - not sure what happens during rush hour but people seemed sensible. had a couple of cocktails and life seemed good!am still not back to baseline but i can see continued improvement, albeit really slowly, and that is all i ask for \ud83e\udd1e still tired at end of day but that could just be an age thing! hope everyone doing ok, be good to get some updates to see what symptoms we are all dealing with now. are we all nearly there?? i really hope so.lx",
          "hi lulu i don't mind what they do now i never thought she would get back to me or my gp i'm hoping they sort it soon but not bothered if they don't used to it now i know what you mean about baseline i keep thinking the same and it's not letting me over the line felt awful earlier today not sure if we are nearly there or not gary",
          "yes lulu that was a few days of peace and quiet which i thoroughly enjoyed \ud83d\ude04 . celebrated my birthday today with my husband at work and kids at home!yes they really need to get their act together with testing, seems like every 2nd family i know is self isolating because someone has symptoms.great you had a good day lulu and feeling good, i'm with gary i'm afraid, don't feel i know where i stand as experiencing muscle pain the type i haven't felt in months, so odd for it to come back. hope it goes soon and hope you feel better gary.",
          "ah happy birthday dane! probably not what you had planned but hope you ended up having a good day.seems they didn't take into account the kids going back to school in the testing fiasco what a complete sh&t show this is. just can't see how we are going to get out of this mess.hope the muscle pain eases off and the kids get back to school soon and you can put your feet up for an hour or two and rest!!take care,lx",
          "i know how you feel gary it's like we've all just been let down by the system and have no expectation of any help - we've had to fend for ourselves the whole way through - if anyone asks how i am now i just reply \"fine\" - it's easier than trying to explain!hope you feel better tomorrow, i follow quite a few people on twitter with long covid and am definitely seeing people reporting big improvements around 6 months so stay positive and we will get there.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu yes i will stay positive i'm just getting tension on the left ear now tight chest now and again but it is easing the odd day when i don't feel good i will wait for the gp to answer the letter and go from there i can relax if i feel the need to i go back to work on the 28th and i still have leave to use if i need it after just ride it out now till we get there i have just read an article in the guardian people are not getting tested because they don't have enough and its the security guard who tells them it's a shambles so they have to either try again or self isolate gary",
          "seems we are about the same now gary.. overall quite good just a few symptoms kicking around. good you can take time off work if you need to its always reassuring. i have been really pushing it last few weeks and been busy out and about every day but seem ok apart from tiredness in evening, throat seems better now i'm back on lansoprazole and coughing and mucus much less - didn't really notice it till i look back but everything has improved a lot even since i was away with my son 4 weeks ago. testing such a shambles - will probably have the security guards giving full medical advice next - they probably know more than the gps which is not difficult!enjoy your day and hope everyone doing ok lx",
          "morning lulu yes it's just lingering for us i think hopefully tension will go soon and tight chest follow i can deal with it now just now and again feel a bit ill i'm doing chores and got a meeting at school later was thinking about a week away might just leave it till next year though enjoy your day too gary",
          "hi everyoneit seems we are all about the same with a few lingering symptoms. i think i'm 8/9 at the moment depending on whether i've done too much. the cold symptoms are always there in some form, but swollen/sore stomach is back when i've done a lot and those hot/cold flu-like symptoms seem to come as a warning to have a rest! but everything is slowly improving so i'll get there eventually hopefullyhave to keep positive and carry on with little or no helpall the best everyonehappy birthday for yesterday dane, hope you get the kids back to school",
          "morning joanne yes it's a long long road with many a lingering symptoms we are all experiencing hanging on issues enjoy the rest of your day also belated birthday wishes dane hope you managed to get kids back to school gary",
          "hi lulu and everyone! thought i'd give you an update. i've not been feeling that great, i'm definitely worse than i was 5 weeks ago as i can't walk as far or as fast. i have had a bit of a palaver with my new doctor surgery. i won't go into it as it pees me off too much. anyway after a frustrated phone call yesterday with the surgery, i have had an ecg today as i have had chest pains throughout these months but worse these last two weeks. turns out i'm tachycardic, so my heart is beating faster than it should be. this doesn't surprise me at all and explains much of what i'm going through. i'm now waiting to see if the docs take it further. at least i got checked out by the nurse today too, who seemed a bit concerned. i've also managed to speak to a doctor (who could almost pass for human) this morning. he's given me steroidal inhalers to try and a sick note so i can apply for esa payments. i feel a bit happier at least. tried finding out about my respiratory referral. called a referral support helpline and was told that they are still getting through the referrals pre covid hitting!!! so i have those people, plus all the other respiratory cases since then up to june in front of me. so.. i'm stuck. apart from chest pain, my main symptoms are fatigue, breathlessness, cough and generally feeling unwell with occasional good patches as long as i do nothing. pretty fed up and wondering what the future holds. sorry to be a bit down. good to see some of you feeling closer to normal. all the best to everyone. stuart",
          "hi stuart and everyone, sorry to hear you've not been great. i had the heart trouble early on but thankfully mine has settled now. lulu you asked about how we're all feeling. i've felt an improvement but like you mention joanne still congested like cold symptoms but not as bad as before. tiredness has improved as well. how are you doing jim ? i know we're both around same time frame. happy belated birthday dane !!",
          "hi gary at least you can have a check over put your mind at rest. think the hot weather is affecting me with my sinuses and mucas bit of hay-fever felt tired the last few day with having to wear the mask in this heat not good. how is everyone else this week. i give myself 9.3/4 this week.",
          "happy birthday dane \ud83c\udf70\ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf88",
          "hi steph, was anything done about your heart problems or did it just get better without treatment? ps dane, i see it was your birthday. hope you had a good one \u263a\ufe0f",
          "hi stuart having never suffered with palpitations before the illness they were quite bad early on. on the 3 occasions i saw paramedics the ecg's they took showed tachycardia and they advised me to speak to my gp and he arranged another ecg in surgery. this didn't show any abnormalities. i think they have cleared up now as i haven't had an episode for a while now. hopefully you get seen stuart as we've been suffering for nearly 6 months now !!",
          "thanks steph i'm glad it seems to have cleared up for you. i'm waiting to see whether the docs do anything now. we'll see. i'll update on here once i know something. hope you have a good evening \ud83d\ude42ps damned autocorrect put your name as stephen and i didn't notice\ud83d\ude44. edited now \ud83d\ude09",
          "hi stuartsorry you're not well. i had the fast heart rate, i had ecg at doctor's surgery which showed tachycardia. i had blood tests to find out why, they came back ok and haven't heard from doctor since. my hr seems to have gradually improved, but it still seems high when i'm walking, especially uphill. hopefully yours will settle down too. all the best",
          "thanks for your reply joanne. seems to be part of this illness. i hope your heart rate settles. have you considered going back to the docs to get it checked? its so strange isn't it, all of this? weirdest thing i've ever experienced. have a good evening \ud83d\ude42",
          "it's awful you haven't been cared for this far stuart. sorry you're still feeling poorly. i guess the good news about the fast heart is that lots of us have had it and it has calmed on it's own. i also had it in weeks 5/6 and it was scary but thankfully it seems ok now. i'm supposed to be getting an appointment with a cardiologist but haven't heard from the hospital so will chase with gp.feel good stuart, better times ahead.thank you all for the birthday wishes!(2 kids back to school today, next 2 tomorrow!)",
          "thanks so much dane. i really appreciate your words. it does give me comfort knowing it's not just me. to be honest i was relieved they detected something as it shows i'm not making it up! yes make sure you chase the cardiologist appt, i'm glad i chased my ecg because they made such a c**k up at the surgery that if i hadn't called to bug them about it i wouldn't have got it at all as it had been noted that i wouldn't have it until i'd been seen by the respiratory team! possibly 6 months away. unbelievable. have a good evening dane, good luck with school stuff. stay well.",
          "hi stuart and everyonesorry you are having these problems stuart. i had the hr problem too and still feel my heart rate is a bit high at times - i checked my apple watch heart app and it showed my hr had gone up to 203 bpm back on 20th august - i know what i was doing as it was when i was away and did a really long walk but no hills - when i told the respiratory guy last week he said it wasn't possible for it to be that high i would have collapsed!! - luckily i didn't notice the reading until two weeks later when i was looking at my overall hr and worked on the assumption i am still here so who knows?!! i have thought about seeing a cardiologist privately but things have definitely improved although i still notice it from time to time. hopefully you will be seen soon but looking at the messages seems we have all had this at some point and i have read others in support groups mention the same, so try not to worry too much.great news susan you are 93/4, i'm probably same not quite there yet but still improving. think you said you were starting nights, really hope going ok.two down, two to go dane \ud83d\ude02 feet up on the sofa for you tomorrow \ud83e\udd1e!take care everyone,lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone i'm still waiting for the phone call or letter from the gp maybe i will get it as a christmas present good to hear from you susan seems like your doing more work now maybe the mask takes time to get used to two kids back to school is good dane had to go see the headmaster yesterday he actually is a good one really helpful i didn't get the cane either \ud83d\ude02 your gp is about as good as my first one stuart actually my new one isn't much better hope you improve soon steph and joanne hopefully your colds get better soon how you feeling jim are you ok gary",
          "thanks lulu, nice to hear from you. yes i can see i'm not alone with the heart problems. i have had it for quite a while but i didn't do anything about it, probably because i didn't want more doctor hassle \ud83d\ude44 i'll be interested to see if they contact me about it. i'm not holding my breath though. how's everyone today? it's nice weather here on the south coast so i'm soaking up some sun. amazing how beneficial that feels. hope you get your phone call /letter from the gp gary. all the best to everyone.",
          "hi stuart like you i'm not holding my breath either not that i'm bothered i think i'm improving every day little tension still and top of my throat gets tight now and again besides that all good gary",
          "great to hear you're improving gary keep it up \u263a\ufe0f",
          "hi stuart, everyoneglad you have been able to enjoy the sunshine, it makes such a difference to how you feel \ud83d\ude0e i'm the same just fed up with it all now - have literally run out of steam but do hope they follow up with cardiologist appointment to put your mind at rest.i've felt pretty good last couple of weeks but woke up this morning feeling chesty, coughed quite a bit and pain in left lung when i inhale - no idea why but seems better again this afternoon - just a little kick up the backside probably to remind me i am not fully recovered!reassuring to know all the gps are as useless as each other gary, thought it might just be mine \ud83d\ude02 two people at work have kids tested positive - huge impact on the rest of family as all need to isolate - one has had to move the child out of the house as his brother has health issues - what a complete sh&t show this is, just can't see an end to it all. reckon there will be a lot of netflix watching this winter as don't think will be going anywhere!lx",
          "hi everyone :)hope you're all ok. lovely day here, not too hot just right for walking, done my 30-40 mins. had a couple of rough days as i forgot to pace earlier in the week, i don't learn! i was just making the most of having more energy and got carried away. i'm feeling better now though and remembering to have restshope you get follow-up from doctor stuart and your hr improves. mine has gradually improved and seems closer to normal nowhave a good day everyone",
          "hi joanne i know what you mean about the energy it is a game now we just have to know how to play it don't over do it it bites us lovely weather today waiting for my daughter to finish work then walk home with her then take dog for a walk and me exercises are done most of the gps are a waste of time lulu probably some out there that will do the best for their patients be nice to find one got the heavy hands and legs today with the tension in the ear enjoy the sun gary",
          "hi guys,did half an hour unscrewing a wooden platform yesterday. that was a mistake, as i spent the rest of the afternoon shattered,been for a further ct scan today but this time with contrast. the contrast injection is horrible and gives you a very strange feeling inside. don't feel too clever now.for some strange reason it's brought on mucus!hope everyone has a lovely weekend.jim.",
          "hi jim just goes to show you gotta keep working out how to play and don't do too much was wondering how you was hoping you feel better soon and try and have a good weekend gary",
          "hello joanne, thanks for your words. i didn't hear anything back from the gp after my ecg result. i phoned just now to find out what to do next, the receptionist said the ecg has been signed by a doc with no notes, so she presumes that they aren't worried about it. i said that i was worried about it though obviously. she said they aren't. i said it's not their body though is it? so i have to phone on monday to speak to a doctor if i want. i can't believe after 25 weeks of being ill they don't think it's worth telling me about it or that it needs further investigation. so annoyed again that i can feel my chest hurting quite a bit. am i being unreasonable to expect a tiny bit of communication? joanne do you monitor your hr? i think it's great that you can walk for that long. i'm half that. have a good day everyone.",
          "take it easy jim r u on lock down up there, they r in burnley \ud83d\ude0a",
          "no lockdown as yet sue but i'm sure it'll happen.everyone i've seen today on my hospital have been so blaise about it all. the only group of people wearing masks outside were the over 50's.",
          "hi stuartthat's awful that they are showing so little interest in you. mine was similar, but i did have follow-up blood tests. hopefully it's because they realise it will improve by itself, but it's not very reassuring for youi used a cheapish wristband to check my hr when walking but it wasn't very accurate and worried me even more. so i ended up getting a runner's chest strap! it gave me the confidence to go walking knowing i could check my hr. i use it with an app on my phone which is really good as it tells me my distance, pace and hr, so i can see the very slow improvements. hope you're feeling better,jim, sounds an awful experience at the hospitalenjoy your walk gary, yes we must keep pacing",
          "hi stuart,totally shocking treatment.i've every right to feel utterly let down.unless you've got your cheque book out no one's bothered.it makes me wonder what doctors and hospitals have been doing since the first wave dipped.",
          "sorry stuart. you've every right to feel let down. oops",
          "morning guys,there's definitely some correlation between weather changes and my symptoms.over the past few days the weather has been summer like, however today is autumn. the result being cold symptoms yet again.hope everyone is well.jim.",
          "it's bad people r so stupid! just had my flu jab done ill let u all know how i get on, it's ok at mo \ud83d\ude1c",
          "hi joanne, thanks for your response. i'll have to look into hr monitors. i would have at least expected some kind of follow up blood test after my ecg for a 52 yr old complaining of chest pains. jim, i agree about the weather it does seem to affect me too. i'm much better in the sun. makes me dread the dark days ahead and the central heating coming on. susan, yes please keep us updated on the jab. good morning to all, hope its a good day.",
          "morning stuart,i'm full of dread and apprehension for the forthcoming autumn and winter. today, yorkshire is gloomy and overcast with a distinct chill in the air. it's not at all inviting but hopefully it'll warm up a bit this morning if the sun makes an appearance.sue i second stuarts comment and would love an update on how you are since your flu jab. one other question, are you having a pneumonia jab?hope everyone has a wonderful sunday.",
          "hi susan & everyonegood to get the flu jab out of the way susan am sure it will be fine and should protect you. i will definitely get it in another few weeks. had a couple of days where not felt that great, especially yesterday. no idea why but was coughing again (anyone else still coughing?), bit chesty, mucus and sore throat. was also exhausted think overdid it last week but this set back made me feel really anxious - think also the rising cases in making me anxious and like jim says the thought of the winter. felt better today but still have mucus in back of throat which makes me cough. i go out as love being sociable (following all the guidelines) and then worry i've been out and who i've been in contact with. just so scared of catching it again when still not recovered. seems the only safe option is to stay home!it's pretty bad the doctor didn't call and run through the results with you stuart to give you some reassurance at least, not good enough to just say if you don't hear all fine. am just not sure what the gps are doing at moment. had a melt down at mine on friday just fed up with being fobbed off and basically have had to pay privately to get any help.anyway, hope everyone doing ok and making progress. it is definitely a long road but have to stay positive and believe things will continue to improve.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu and good morning to all. i'm still coughing lulu, especially the last few weeks. i remember back in the summer having good patches where it disappeared but now it is a daily thing and it seems to be something i have to do to try and clear that congested chesty feeling and also to clear mucus. this sounds terrible and yucky but sometimes i cough and i have thick globules of mucus flying out of my throat that seems to have gathered there \ud83d\ude23 its surprising and weird. my mum said to me yesterday that i haven't had a good patch for a while now, which is true but i hadn't thought about it. i was having more and more good patches in the summer but these last 5 weeks i haven't had a single one. i can't walk as far as i was say 5 weeks ago without a bad reaction. there is always something. i agree about the ecg thing, what's the point of having it and being told you're tachycardic only for it to be passed off as nothing, with no communication or reasoning ? i was going to phone up this morning to book a chat about it but i have decided to delay it. i couldn't be bothered with sitting on the phone for thirty minutes trying to get through with the 8am rush for appointments. i dread all gp appointments now as they generally make me feel worse. what did your gp say to you after your meltdown lulu? also, with the flu jab, is it something your gp can arrange or are you going to pay for it? i asked about it but was told it was for people with underlying conditions. i'm interested in the pneumonia jab too but again i don't know if its a good idea or not. with winter coming i think the prospect of dark days and central heating worries me with the way my breathing is. i am hoping for a miracle recovery and as much warm bright weather to extend into the winter months as possible. despite all my apparent doom and gloom i am trying to stay positive. today could be a good day. or tomorrow! mustn't give up. hope everyone has a bright and well day. stuart",
          "hi all a carer stuart so get the jab but i think they r doing all over 50's now? i asked about pneumonia one but to young but u can pay for one. i'm the same get fatigue alot feel like i gave a gold coming, then mucas and a slight cough at times it never ending. i get worried having the grandkids etc but we have to live as well! it's a hard one.",
          "so far jab been ok no effects fingers crossed also asked about pneumonia jab but said i'm to young lol i'm 58 but i can pay privately for one will ask the pharmacy about it, my sister had one she was under 60.",
          "afternoon susan and everyone ive still not heard anything from doctor i'm wondering if they have binned it i've been out for a bike ride i'm not sure if you remember when i got the bike i got all the tension in my head neck and lungs felt it that day not sure how long ago it was think i'm forgetting things a lot as well anyway no tension except my hands tingling only done a few miles resting in between will walk my daughter home today as well and see how i feel tomorrow still getting the ear tingling but comes and goes chest is easing as well does anyone get like heavy legs feeling after exercise gary",
          "hi susan, yes we have to live. i've seen my kids recently, one at a time. i haven't seen them together since xmas. i can't not see people and i don't want to wrap myself in cotton wool. i've put it out of my mind and decided life's a risk no matter what we do. i just keep it as low a risk as possible without it being excessive. sounds like your symptoms are similar to mine too.take care. stuart",
          "hi everyone :)sorry you've not been well, lulu, hope you're on the up again. i think these setbacks pick on our weak points (from covid) mine always affects my stomach as well as the usual cold/flu symptoms. i usually get anxious too, i think because it reminds me of when i had the virus, and i wouldn't want to go through that againi get the heavy legs gary, could be to do with energy levels, i get it towards the end of my walk and if i'm feeling tiredgood news on the flu jab, susan, i think we need all the protection we can gethope you get good days soon stuart, you're definitely due for somei'm still trying to pace, nearly back to where i was before latest setbackall the best everyone",
          "morning gary,how are you today after your bike ride and walk?",
          "morning jim like joanne said i've got the heavy legs again and tired but i can take it easy today i've got to work out the energy levels may be when the tight chest eases right down i can go further will walk home with my daughter today and hopefully have more energy tomorrow how you getting on has the mucus eased or still the same what about your walking it's really slow for me but i feel better every day gary",
          "gary,the mucus has reduced considerably. thank you. its more throat based now.when the fatigue kicks in i get the cold symptoms, nose blocking and a sore lumpy throat feel totally drained.i've become lax with the walking but started up again over the past couple of days.had the results of my final ct scan that was for circulation, blood vessels etc. oh and to check for blood clots. all clear.so of all the tests have come back clear, which is good news.just got to get over the fatigue.",
          "that's good news jim all the tests are all clear you have to try to keep up with the walking that will help you with your symptoms but you know it's hard to find the right level because of the fatigue everything is easing with me but it is so hard to get it right i know not to ride the bike today fatigue is so hard to work out just a walk home with my daughter and some housework for me today looks like we are heading for another lock down as well gary",
          "hi gary, i get the heavy legs. if i go beyond that particular day's unknown energy limit it will hit me as i'm walking home. i slow right down and i know i've done too much. i'm keeping my walks to just under 20 minutes at the moment and if i go further i make sure i sit on a bench for a while to rest. jim my symptoms are very like yours when the fatigue hits me. sounds identical except i get a cough and breathless feeling too. the lump in the throat is driving me mad. like i have a dry obstruction that needs swallowing. so strange. joanne, thanks for your good wishes \ud83d\ude0agood morning and good health to everyone today.",
          "hi stuart been trying to work out the heavy legs for ages i was getting it in the hands as well its eased there may be it's just a reminder don't push me i've got the chest this morning and the ear tension comes and goes just doing the cleaning in the kitchen and washing up so maybe there is a link to not pushing it hopefully you get a few good days stuart you deserve a break gary",
          "i've just read an article on the bbc news about fatigue like i've never experienced before type in bbc news then uk a young girl called natasha she has basically been through the same as us and is still ill but she is getting support now as i was saying we have to work out how to manage the fatigue know when to rest etc i've still not heard anything back from the doctor and it seems like thousands of people are in the same boat because they still don't know how to deal with it what a shambles just goes to show you google should be our gps gary",
          "just read it gary.we've all been left to fend for ourselves, which is disgusting.i echo her comments about the ambulance service too.on the 5th of april 20:35 i rang for an ambulance, which never arrived. i received a call at 01:10 on the 6th of april and when i spoke to the caller she said my breathing was okay and cancelled the call.that same day i again called for an ambulance, which turned up. they took my sats said they weren't bad enough to carry. they surmised i was over anxious!shameful.",
          "cheers gary, i'll take a look. just been for a walk. no heavy legs today but i did sit on a couple of benches. i await the body reaction now i'm home and sitting down. keep it up gary, you sound like you're soldiering on. well done.",
          "just read it gary. very interesting and sad. the thing i want to read about now is about someone who is better. we can hope. ps tight chest, mucus and lump in throat just hit me after my walk. bloody weird.",
          "totally agree with you stuart.",
          "i echo yours and jim's thoughts exactly stuart i've just taken the dog for a walk only 20 minutes and feel the tight chest and ear tension and neck so it's lingering only 6 months when i look back now jim i laugh because im not sure if all the pills and vitamins have had any effect at all and maybe should have just took water and paracetamol like they said in the first place and stayed in bed hibernating might be one for the doctors to look gary",
          "gary,funnily enough i said something similar the other day.think of the money we've collectively spent on pills and potions all to no gain.i'm like you i don't think any of them helped.i'm sticking to a decent diet, booze and gentle, short terms of exercise.",

          "hi everyonejust caught up on the posts, seems like all still struggling with symptoms. i started feeling unwell last thurs, wasn't too bad friday, saturday literally sat around all day as so tired, bit better sunday but monday, tuesday pretty awful. thick/sore throat with lump, chest feels cloggy, tired eyes, headache, inflamed tongue - have to say feeling really worried - this is just not right after over 6 months. had an emotional couple of days having to clear my mum's flat but genuinely believe these are physical symptoms not emotional symptoms. i just don't know what else we can do - i agree gary i don't think all the supplements, nose washes and everything else has helped at all other than cost us loads of money! just listening to sky news saying why would government go for herd immunity with long covid so prevalent in young people and people up to age 59 - people are waking up to the long symptoms but still no medical solutions. am feeling a bit despondent but maybe am just tired, hopefully will pick up again in next few days. feel like no-one really understands other than you guys, was trying to tell my brother last couple of days but it was like water off a duck's back he just doesn't get it!anyway, thanks for listening and hopefully it is just a blip!take care everyone,lx",
          "hi jim and everyone, i'm really pleased about all your results coming back clear that's great jim. we must be coming up to the 6 month mark now. i've been reading lots of news stories about people who've gone through similar to us. the article with natasha said she'd fainted too !! agree with you and gary about all the meds we have tried and tested must add up to a fair bit but when you're desparate like we were you try anything that you think might help. hope you're doing ok jim",
          "hi jim that's great news it's just a time thing now for you let's hope that's not long. it's worrying about the virus again wish it would just do one now. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22",

          "thanks sue and steph i appreciate your kind words.i don't think the virus is going anywhere soon seeing how poorly this has been handled from the start.one thing that is certain there are a lot more people going to suffer with the virus.",

          "yep me too jim - would have been a very lonely time without you guys and the support.lx",
          "hi susanit is just relentless, every time you think you are nearly there it hits again. i haven't felt this bad for a long time and started worrying i've caught it again and also i think starting the winter from such a low health baseline is really worrying me in case catch something else as just don't feel have the strength to fight off anything else. sorry to hear your sister is still suffering - did she get sick same time as us?take care,lx",
          "sorry you're still suffering lulu. i think the emotional stuff affects me as much as the physical. we've had a lot of worry about f-in-law in and out of hospital, and i'm sure my symptoms have been worse yes great test results, jim, must be a relief has anyone read paul garner update, all about pacing :)",
          "hello lulu. i'm very sorry to hear you're feeling down. we all understand - i'm sure i can speak for everyone on here. from my perspective i'm amazed you do as much as you do. i cannot imagine having to clear my mum's place right now. i couldn't even attempt it. even if i was fully fit and healthy i'd find it wearing. i think you should be congratulated for even attempting to do it after being so ill. i wouldn't underestimate the emotional impact either, from my experience stress and excitement hit me pretty hard now and bring on all the usual symptoms. i think we all want to carry on as normal but there is a price to pay for every cent of energy we spend it seems. i'm certain we'll get there, all of us, but not as quickly as we would like. i sincerely hope you feel better tomorrow /today, i'm sure we are all wishing it for you. take care. stuart",
          "morning lulu and everyone it's going to be a tough few days for you lulu luckily my sister done my mums flat for us just over five years ago now also it won't help being ill as well but you have to bring your strong side back out to help you we all understand how hard it is when family and friends even work colleagues look at us and think when is he going to stop going on about the bloody thing not that i bother much now occasionally a couple of friends who know i'm not lying ask me even they must think surely you're better now well guess what no i'm not but like all of us wishing we were there and i know i do too but like jim and stuart said maybe for you time to get the prosecco out had a few beers with my mates last night and boris popped on the telly in the pub was thinking has he really had it and has he fully recovered hope you're feeling better today lulu it's raining here gary",
          "i listened to a really interesting podcast about hr monitoring. although it mostly referred to me, it could be useful for us. they were saying that you calculate your appropriate hr levels and try to keep within them. if you go above them then you're using energy that you don't have, and that's why you get symptoms. it was quite technical, and i didn't understand it all, but it was really interesting. worth a try, but i think i'll be sitting on the sofa a lot and doing snailwalking :)",
          "thanks stuart and everyone for your support i know you all understand and i really appreciate it - as you say maybe i underestimated the task both physically and emotionally - just struggling to know how to deal with this illness now but i think maybe the most helpful thing i can do for next couple of weeks is to lower my expectations of what i can do and rest more and maybe a couple of glasses of prosecco will perk me up! hope everyone else doing well and staying positive i'll bounce back in a day or two! lx",
          "thanks gary appreciate it, it is so hard you can't keep telling people that you don't feel well but then if you don't they assume you are completely fine and expect you to help clear flats etc!! - some people are a lot more understanding than others. yep think boris is looking better but be surprised if he doesn't still have symptoms but he's not going to be telling any of us that in case we think not fit to run country - as if!! meeting my prosecco tuesday mate on a wednesday!! hoping it does the trick and cheers me up! hope work is ok and things are generally good with you. take care,lx",
          "thanks jo - i just replied but no idea where it posted! will keep an eye on hr on watch.hope you are ok and doing well.lx",
          "morning lulu you go for it get a few proseccos down you and stuff everyone else i think a few beers actually helps me i relax and a few months ago i remembered the peroni didn't agree with me but now i got to the stage where i think it helps i'm still off work till monday that's when i start back on seven nights so if i get through that i will know i have improved have a good day you deserve it and enjoy it gary",
          "morning guys,gary, i'm sure you'll manage your seven nights pal. keep in the peroni!lulu, it must be incredibly hard to go through that. i categorically know i couldn't manage that. take it easy and carry on drinking. it definitely helps.steph, we're week 25 tomorrow. who'd have thought we'd still be on here now.sue, how do you listen to the podcast?i'm feeling washed out today. may be it's the weather change.",
          "morning jim i've got to the stage now where i'm thinking gotta try and get on with it if it hits me i will be ill but only for a while i've got to manage the two together thats a lot easier than it was two months ago afraid i can't stop working and go to the pub now that would help so if my tight chest comes work through it if it's head and ear tension same sooner or later it will ease but at the moment it still comes back but we all know in time it will change and i'm hoping do one maybe get a phone call from gp before 2022 not holding my breath though enjoy your day jim hope the weather improves gary",
          "evening guys,i have just received a reply from my mp via one of her case workers.it's only taken eight weeks for a reply after having numerous requests to resend the original information. apparently, there's been an unknown problem with the email system.right, the reply strangely enough came a couple of days after my respiratory physiotherapy appointment was due.my mp hopes this has helped the situation. i've replied informing her my appointment was cancelled last week after waiting since june.i bet i don't get a further reply.what a total waste of time and effort!",
          "you couldn't make it up jim i just don't understand it but i still don't understand why my gp hasn't phoned and they got the letter last week they probably just waiting for me to ring them we just been left to get on with it so i will and hopefully it'll get better one day gary",

          "afternoon everyone,i hope we're all well and tickerty boo.from sue's information on the me heart rate podcast i somehow ended up on youtube watching a video by bmj.it's entitled; long covid, diagnosis management and prognosis.i'm not really into all these videos etc, however this is via the british medical journal and is quite informative. there were a couple of points i picked up on. firstly, ace inhibitor blood pressure tablets should be maintained if taken and steroids should be prescribed from the onset.well, that's a taster. watch it.i've also watched a video via a link from the me physio website explaining the heart rate monitoring and how to use it.pretty simple really when you pick through the bones of it.firstly, subtract your age from the maximum heart rate. then multiply that number by 0.55, which will give you a number. mines 92.they recommend not going above 92 heart rate to suppress the onset of fatigue and associated symptoms.thoughts on s postcard to.....",
          "thanks jim,i'll check it out. the bmj website has some interesting articles regarding 'long covid'. shame the gps don't seem to read it! \ud83d\ude32my thoughts on a postcard would be;'wish we weren't here!'",
          "stuart, i second that thought pal.when i listened to the two videos i could have lost my temper.paul garner was scathing of the nhs response to out condition.seeing as though i've had a hectic day doing nothing i'm on the red tonight!!!",
          "my exact thoughts too stuart - this is really all getting to me at the moment. i can start the day with one symptom and end with three different ones - no idea how going to feel one hour to next. daily mail had an article about boris needs to recognise long covid today - read a few comments and many people suggesting all in the mind but not saying that in quite such a pleasant way!! - unbelievable the lack of acknowledgement and sympathy.i think i feel worse this last week than i have for a long time but think i remember you saying same quite recently?thanks for the hr info jim will work mine out. i feel so tired worse than before anyone else feeling this?take carelx",
          "hi jimi subtracted 61 (my age) from 136 (my highest hr today) gave me 75 and x 0.55 which gave me 41.25?!! maths not my strong point maybe? any ideas please.l x",
          "hi lulu, the maximum heart rate is 220 i think, then subtract your age and then multiply by 0.55",
          "hi lulu,stuart is spot on.i know where you've gone wrong.....your not 61!",
          "lulu, i'm sorry you're having a bad time. i have had a rotten few weeks as i mentioned before. nowhere near what i was. i just hope it's a blip and a reaction to doing more than i/we should. i also wake feeling fine and end the day with cough, tight chest, congestion etc etc. just like you. i presume it's because i've used the day's energy. i am always worse in the evening. let's hope it's temporary for us \ud83d\ude42\ud83e\udd1ei'm going to buy a heart rate monitor but i need something convenient and accurate. i've taken my blood pressure several times today, it also monitors my hr and i seem to be fine, totally normal. thing is my heart seems to be pounding and doesn't feel normal to me. monitoring it seems to be the way to go. as for online comments about long covid i've seen terrible ones and i once posted on a comment section elsewhere to let people know about what was happening and got some very dismissive sarcastic comments back. people don't want to accept that there is a third and very nasty angle to cv19.all the best.",
          "ok thanks stuart that makes it 87 - think goes higher than that just going upstairs! but will keep an eye on it.l x",
          "that made me laugh jim! i used to feel about 21 pre covid now feel about 91 - its taken its toll! how you doing?l x",
          "what are you using to monitor it lulu? \ud83d\ude42",
          "thanks stuart, today i have been working and been on a couple of calls and sitting all day but as day has gone on i felt breathless, chest feels woolly, can feel it in my lungs and pretty exhausted from not doing anything physically. i think that is exactly right no-one wants to accept the third angle to c19 but many viruses have prolonged symptoms and cause post viral fatigue like mumps, glandular fever but think it is the breathing and heart issues that sets this apart - it is not just the fatigue it is the ongoing physical symptoms. i think the guy i saw who said they believe there are microscopic changes to lungs, heart which don't show up on scans but cause symptoms is probably right.anyway seems we have done all we can and now just hoping we fully recover and need to stay positive.lx",

          "lulu,i echo your sentiments wholeheartedly.good old gary made a comment the other day, which really resonated with me.gary said and i quote- i've got to the stage now where i'm thinking gotta try and get on with it if it hits me i will be ill but only for a whiletop man!!!",
          "me too jo, i even shock myself when i say i'm 61 \ud83d\ude31 - but def think age was against us with this, the others that caught it at work were in their 30s/40s seem to have recovered well.so no hilly walks for me for a while, i do wonder if i did too much right at beginning but was so desperate to get fit again and tbf the specialist said do as much as you can although when i saw him this time and asked how he was as he had been sick with it and in hospital he said he was doing ok but \"i don't challenge myself like you do\" so maybe that is the answer! reckon he was mid 60s.yes don't think the weather helps but i started feeling rough end of last week when it was still pretty warm. seems there is no rhyme nor reason!!take care jo.lx",

          "hi danegreat to hear from you. amazing what you are coping with but the thing is with kids you don't get a lot of choice but great you are managing, bet you are sleeping well!! so reassuring for you from your consultant too.interesting the tests all seem to come back clear for everyone, think we have mostly found the same only thing my respiratory guy found was the small patch of pneumonia in my right lung but was only small. i reckon it must be the immune system still overreacting causing all these ongoing symptoms - it feels like it as seem super sensitive to everything. on my consultants letter he has mentioned allergic rhinitis and also the reflux - didn't have either before!!yes, you have just blown my age theory right out the water \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 and tbh a lot of the longcovid support groups have younger people still struggling months later.interesting about the lansoprazole i wonder if you can just take it as and when you feel symptoms or throat sore - ent guy who prescribed it told me to try stopping it, respiratory guy told me important to take it as the acid damages the throat and voice box - now who do i listen to?!anyway, great you are doing so well and hope husband's cold clears up quickly.lx",

          "hello there my friend,may i ask you what type of vitamins are you taking, and at what dosage? vitamins will not work unless taken at the proper dosage, and of course you already know this. we've had quite a few people in my family catch c19, as well. thank you.thomas",
          "good to hear it jim that you're feeling ok your pal might be right as well but i'm a slow drinker compared to my mates but that may have something to do with the strength of the drink and im quite happy to stop when i've had my quoter sometimes i forget but i usually make it home fine enjoy your day too jim sort of a autumn feeling down here windy and sunny gary",
          "guys,there's an article in the daily mail, which says the government have recognised long covid.the article relates to sage suggesting everyone over 45 should shield.it's worth a read.",
          "cheers jim will have a look gary",
          "read both of them wish they would have shielded us start of march might not feel like we do now i noticed they mentioned hair loss as a symptom that would be the next one coming then not had that yet \ud83d\ude05even though they may recognise long covid now jim i'm not so sure how they can help us and even if they are going to get their acts together to try they are probably going to have their hands full with the next lot maybe they will give them something a bit stronger than paracetamol and water still not convinced anything works against it maybe one or two of the experts has an idea think we've gotta ride it out mate they might even throw the blood tests out of the window don't remember anyone having anything show up on any of them hopefully the strength of the virus has weekened otherwise its going to be a long winter for some people gary",
          "i know what you mean gary about the shielding. if i hadn't caught it at the end of march work would have offered me shielding from april as i take bp tablets.they're the breaks hey!i can't see the majority doing it.the problem lies with openings schools and universities, as the majority of school and college live at home. obviously it spreads round schools and then home.your right the medical professionals have no idea and its worth watching the youtube video titled; long covid daiagnosis management prognosis. it's quite enlightening.regarding blood tests, ct scans, ecg's, cardigrams all have come back as normal. i know lulu had a slight small area on her lung and i've got an extra heartbeat every now and again but i had that before.oh stuart had a very low vitamin d count on a blood test. but other than that nothing.however, if you look on the bmj website they list tests, which should be considered for each degree of severity of illness.none of us have been looked after how we should have nor what they now recommend. i can't remember anyone on the nhs having a ct scan.well that's enough bleating by me.i'm off to watch the bike racing.",
          "thanks stuart, i'll have to get a bottle of rum, certainly need it in this cold weather. do you drink it neat? i used to love rum&coke :)i don't think i'd do well in a pub, gary, i'd forget the rules, i've only just got used to remembering what to do in shopsthanks for the info, jim, i'll have a look at that, glad you're feeling better, hope it laststhanks for update on jab, susan, sounds temptinghope you're feeling better, lulu, my cold symptoms seem a bit better(shouldn't have said that, they'll be back)as well as that i've mainly got the tingly arms/legs i'm trying to do things more slowly when i remember, not sure if it's helpingenjoy your weekend everyone :)",
          "has anyone looked at the nhs website, your covid recovery.it's worth reading and a shame no one in the nhs follows the policy.",
          "hi thomasi only take nutri-immunoblast which is a high dose multi vitamin in the winter. i am not big into taking vitamin supplements as i eat a healthy balanced diet and when blood tests came back i was not showing any deficiencies.sorry to hear you have family members who have had c19 - hope they are recovering well.lx",
          "hi jim and everyonei'll take a read jim, but as gary said bit late for us but hopefully those who are older and more vulnerable are taking things seriously and limiting their risk but it is impossible unless you shut yourself away completely. i met a colleague for lunch today she was sick at same time as me and three others in our office but only for a couple of weeks and thought it probably wasn't covid as very mild symptoms sore throat etc. no lung/breathing issues, not seen her since march she was very tearful as still feels unwell - sore throat and lump in throat most evenings, tinnitus, ear ache, head cold, aching eyes , hyper allergic with terrible hayfever all summer and super sensitive to everything including her pets which she has had for years with no problems before - she just kept saying i feel so poorly and it comes and goes - and this was an extremely mild case and she says still not sure i had it but it seems pretty conclusive to me - she is in an even worse situation than us as no one has even acknowledged she has had it - just shows even the very mild cases can suffer for months too.anyway hope everyone is doing ok, i am feeling much better than earlier in the week have a bit of a tight chest and mucus (are you still taking mucodyne jim and how is your mucus?!). i think mine is worse if i don't walk but it is a balancing act - if i don't do a long hilly walk i have more energy but the mucus builds, if i walk the mucus seems to shift but i use all my energy!!sorry your bike ride wasn't as good as you hoped gary but two miles is still good and glad you had a good night out with your mates. enjoy your evening everyone and have a large rum, gin, whisky, prosecco or whatever takes the edge of things!lx",
          "ok i understand. well, i hope you feel better very soon. good luck with finding something that works for you to ease your suffering and pain. take care.",
          "hi lulu, i'm down to one tablet carbonistiene three times a day of my own volition.my mucus production has reduced and now it's in my throat. it may be a coincidence but i've been prescribed and use a steroid inhaler, which could be the reason. my consultant did say it may well dry the mucus.over the past three days i've noticed the lump in my throat has become more prevalent, which is annoying.the heart rate plot has moved me to be more sedentary, which i struggle to fathom. i'm trying to do a couple of walks no longer than 20 minutes and i haven't had a crash since. well, not yet.i'm back working on friday but from home on reduced hours. god knows how i'll cope with late afternoons and nights but i've got to try.oh on the nhs \"yourcovidrecovery\" it says if your symptoms persist over 12 months it will be classed as a disability.",
          "hi jim and everyoneme too more mucus in the nose and throat these days - and i regularly get the lump feeling in throat but if you google it says common with reflux - i am still not convinced it is reflux but think the mucus is caused by the inflammation.i think you have done well with pacing yourself jim, it is sensible, i am rubbish at it and always do too much and like last week take a big dip. i have a busy week again this week but am going to try and rest in between. such good news about work jim, it is a huge step in right direction back to normality and may be tough but from where you were a couple of months ago a huge achievement. i stayed on reduced hours for 8 weeks in the end and it really helped.seems we are on a long slow recovery, just a matter of time for all of us and i reckon if we play our cards right we will be fine within the year. the thing i have to remind myself is that i didn't feel great every day before this happened even though was fit and healthy (as far as i know) so not likely i will after!! i equate it to one of the gov graphs where there are peaks and troughs but overall going in right direction.hope everyone has had a good weekend, and recharged the batteries for the week ahead.lx",
          "hi lulu,jim, gary and everyone,afraid all down hill for me.i've caught a simple cold from my son 2 weeks ago. been dreadful. it's now progressed down into my chest which as you all know is still super tight and of course i still have post covid cough etc...last few days i literally don't know what to do with myself. the level of inflammation is insane. my throat is like sandpaper and i'm actually scared to cough because the noise imaging is frankly disturbing it's so horrific and feel like i'm injuring myself from coughing so hard.getting the mucous up is hard and feel like my tubes are sticking together and on fire. a very bad bronchitis on top of post covid brochial symptoms...i do recommend you all be careful even catching normal winter bugs. i'm in nightmare. have just emailed my specialist as coughing up specks of blood and really anxious to be honest now. it's def not covid but the combination of post covid symptoms plus a new virus is overwhelming me. feel physically awful but also of course mentally dreadful with all the back history of the last 6 months still in the rear view. feel really distressed. sorry for the negative rant but i don\u2019t know how much more of this year i can take.",
          "oh res,i'm so sorry to hear your news and no need to apologise either.a trip to a&e sounds in order to me.i hope your well asap.hugs.",
          "yup i'm 37 too! glad you are making headways dane.",
          "so sorry to hear this res, just what you didn't need on top of everything else you have been through last six months. you must need antibiotics at the very least - do you have any you can start until you hear back from specialist? as jim said, it would be a good idea to go to a&e and get checked out it is better sooner rather than later - it's so easy to put it off keep thinking things will improve on their own but you know you are starting from a physically low ebb so don't want to take any chances and sounds like you are feeling in a bad way. you can explain the history and why you are so worried and am sure they will check you out and give you the right medication.keep us posted and will be thinking of you. sending you a big hug \ud83e\udd17lx",
          "thanks lulu,the gp has given me amoxicillin but it's getting worse not better which leads me to think the main issue is inflammation on top of inflammation.then again...had so many antibiotics this year am not certain amoxicillin will any longer touch the sides\ud83d\ude02.will hold on till tomoz and hopefully can speak to specialist. what a year!\ud83d\ude31",
          "thanks jim.kind of at my wits end at this point.think will hold off on a&e tonight and see if can speak to specialist tomoz. perhaps even an inhaler of some kind would help.saw my dad on friday across the garden, who has industrial asthma and copd..even he was commenting on how bad my cough is, which is saying something coming from him. really hope it turns a corner soon. thanks for your good wishes",
          "yes am sure he will be in touch in morning and advise you what to do. take care res, hope you get a good night's sleep and feel better in the morning.thinking of you.lx",
          "hi res and everyone, sorry to hear you've been poorly. i echo jim and lulu about a trip to a&e but only you know best. my daughter has a cold so i'm being extra careful not to catch it. my symptoms now are like a never ending cold so don't fancy catching another one. jim i hope work goes ok and reduced hours are the way to go for now , just listen to your body. lulu hope you have a better week. it's going to be harder to manage the symptoms now that we can't escape to sunbathe in the garden but hopefully with each day we will all feel a bit better.",
          "really sorry you're feeling so rough, res, hope you get some help today from your specialist, and you start to feel better. all the best to you, you've been through so muchgood luck with work this week, jim, slow and steady does it, you'll get therei'm still trying to pace, but the slow walking doesn't suit me! i've gone back to normal walking, keeping an eye on my hrhave a good day everyone :)",
          "hi res i don't know what to say really seems like your going through an awful time to tell you the truth i really thought we would all be through this and getting on with our lives age's ago now i realise not as easy as i thought i remember you saying a little while ago you was worried about the winter coming and now i realise why i hope you improve soon i've never been one to worry about winter because like i said before i'm never ill might have to have a rethink now res hope you get the blood problem sorted soon gary",
          "gary,i'm very much the same. illness, weather, seasons have never previously crossed my mind. barring my first job, which was office bound i've always been out and about.this year i've changed and seeing sue hasn't had any bad reactions to the flu jab i'll be having one.",
          "i can understand that jim and i don't blame you but for some reason i don't know why but i think it will not agree with me and like i said before i've never had to worry about a cold or flu because i've just got on with it i am actually thinking about getting one but i may wait a few weeks as i'm still hoping my flu like symptoms might do one gary",
          "thanks gary, i'm super down about it to be honest. life post-covid just feels like such an uphill struggle . becoming harder and harder to pull myself up mentally. my body is just so depleted and feel very down. specialist wants to put me on a steroid that my father, who has copd, is on. has quite a lot of side effects but if it gives me some quality of life may be worth it. really hope we all improve in time. stay safe gary.",
          "thanks joanne.i really wish i had happier news. been such a bad month healthwise...one thing after another. body feels totally exhausted.i'm trying to pace too. it's frustrating but necessary i think. hope rest of your week goes well!",
          "hi res been out working at the moment weather is not good for working in hammering down fully understand how things are getting you down and it is an uphill struggle you gotta keep fighting though res it will get easier in time hopefully the steroids work and give you relief i've stopped taking medication now to tell you the truth i'm not sure if it works anyway dr hillary was on tv this morning saying drink plenty of water and take paracetamol think it's a waste of time who knows maybe in time they will find something that work's hope you pick up soon res take care gary",
          "morning,there's an interesting article on the daily mail website where a series of doctor's have described their plight with long covid.the majority sounds much worse than us, bless them.don't bother reading adjacent posts, as the none believers seem to have been up early this morning.hope everyone is well and has a good day.jim.",
          "morning jim i will have a look at daily mail i was reading a google article about a non believer who went to tenerife saying its all a load of blah blah blah now in watford general only 29 may be woke a few people up had a bit of a struggle last night climed a lot of stairs with a couple of jack's needed a breather after that hope you're feeling good mate gary",
          "hi reshope steroids help you and you get some relief sooni've had the return of some of my earlier symptoms, blocked nose, tight chest etc etc. i've started on the honey drinks and trying to remember what worked last time. it will get better, it's just going to take time, we have to keep positivethere's a programme on radio 4 about long covid, not sure what it's about, could be what we've already heardtake care everyone",
          "very interesting article jim just goes to show you even the professionals are struggling with it as well 60 thousand they reckon now with long covid still don't think matt hancock and even boris have had it or if so perhaps they have better parectamol and water than dr hillary recommended hope you are having a good day gary",

          "having watched the lunchtime news 60,000 suffering are the reported cases over 3 months suffering. they are estimating alot more. possibly running into hundreds of thousands.",
          "just goes to show you jim it's going to be even worse for the ones who get it now unless the virus is not as strong now even if they know more than before the so called experts what are they going to treat them with if they had something surely they would be putting it forward not parectamol and water and a vaccine isn't showing up yet mind you they still haven't a clue with the testing yet and that chaos with the students saw the sign that said please help send beer that will be better than paracetamol gary",
          "hi garyi don't think the tight chest went, but i think my breathing is not as good and seem more congested. also had tingly/sore legs back which i think may be nerve pain.walking seems to help with all this, so long as i don't overdo it. it's like juggling!",
          "gary,it's been an utter cluster f..k from start upto now.from not closing the borders, starting lockdown late, testing, track and trace. everything has been a debacle of epic proportions.we are the laughing stock of the world running parallel with the us by the utter disregard for the health and safety of our citizens.i can see alot more people who are going to suffer as we have and are doing.the government have blood on their hands.end of rant.",

          "evening susan and everyonei don't watch the news, what else did they say? it doesn't sound very positive. the heart thing has certainly made me think. my heart has been pumping like mad these last few days. it has got worse these last weeks in combination with my breathlessness and fatigue increasing. i have two hr monitors now and they can't both be wrong when they show the same hr. i'm in the nineties at rest which i'm sure isn't right. i spoke to my doc who seems to think there is no problem despite me being tachycardic. he just doesn't listen or seem to have put two and two together when i told him my story. i feel totally ignored and i can't explain why he is trying to fob me off. all of that of course makes the hr go up!res, i'm very sorry to hear you're unwell. without you we wouldn't have this forum. i hope you improve very quickly. it's easy at the moment to start to feel a bit down, as it's all gone on so long but we have to try and be positive. i just hope our bodies are going through a period of repair which will explain this bad period i and everyone else seems to be experiencing. hopefully there is going to be some recognition soon for all of us. take care everyone. s x",

          "hi susan, i agree with you - we should be checked over again. my doc looks at blood tests from april and thinks nothing has changed when i know i'm feeling worse. i wish my hr levels were as good as yours, yesterday evening they were in the low hundreds just sitting doing nothing. hoping for a better day for all of us. best wishes.",
          "i'm sorry you're feeling alone with this stuart. think the doctors in general are so new to this themselves and our stories are so long and complex by this point that they don't really know what to do. even when i hear myself trying to explain things i feel like i must sound quite confusing. i'm feeling a little better today but oxygen went down a bit and breathing was bit troubled.that's sorted itself a bit since i took a reliever inhaler...i am more and more certain that covid has left me with some kind of asthma. really hope we all soon get the help we need as asking so often is starting to feel shaming.",
          "thanks dane,i'm trying to keep my chin up just feel like reserves are low..makes me feel for my poor dad. he has copd and just trying to remind myself that this is the poor guys daily experience of life for years. bloody awful.",
          "thanks res, i'm glad you're feeling a bit better, i feel terrible for you. interesting what you say about asthma, i feel very similar. a ventolin inhaler definitely improves my peak flow readings and i find myself using it more and more now especially after eating. the frustrating thing is that the tests aren't being run to test us for asthma or copd. i'm the same with explaining my situation to the doc. i get quite tongue tied and frustrated especially as they seem to be in such a rush. with all the increase in publicity about long covid let's hope our situations change. maybe it's nonsense but i feel like the virus is still present inside me, hiding, and attacking something new every few weeks. i remember reading about a patient in china way back at the beginning of all this that couldn't shift the illness. it was commented that the virus and body had reached a kind of mutual agreement and it stayed there as an unwelcome visitor. he was cured by injecting blood serum of a person who had recovered. that story has stuck with me for months. anyway, let's hope for brighter days soon. hope you continue to improve res. all the best to everyone.",
          "afternoon stuart,yes, my pf goes up after using my reliever inhaler. i mentioned to my consultant and he said it would as it opens up the airways.i've heard today he's referred me back into the nhs under him. thank god.this morning i spoke to my gp and it's so much easier to speak to someone who's followed you through the illness. they are fully au fait with the chronological order of symptoms, medications, decisions made and why. obviously this eliminates the need of repartition everytime you call etc.thankfully my current gp took personal responsibility for my care when she saw my notes and that i hadn't had certain tests after eight weeks.what should happen is once a patient has been identified as a covid sufferer a gp should be allocated and they should see the patients care through to fruition.",
          "hi jim, my problem has been i have never had one gp in control of my situation. i changed address and had to sign up to a new place a couple of months back so i'm starting all over again. i thought my last place was bad but the new one has made me realise how good the last place was in comparison. i called to see if my old surgery would take me back but they said they can't as my post code is outside of their catchment area. i have lost access to a very helpful respiratory nurse. the new place seems amateurish.you're right about identifying someone as a covid sufferer but my gp has said \"if you had covid\" as if he is doubting it, and \"if you have long covid i won't be able to help you.\" frustrating feeling of not being taken seriously. i'm think i'm going to have to spend what little money i have left to go private. shocking really.",
          "stuart,i'm disgusted in what the gp has said to you but not surprised. we've discussed this before and being honest i've had similar conversations with other gp's. thankfully my current gp is a diamond.",
          "good afternoon everyone i've just had a phone call from sarah she is the speech and language therapist team leader she said have i heard anything from my doctor and obviously i have not she rings me about every four weeks as she speaks to a lot of long covid people she has all my notes etc she said everything is taking a lot longer than usual but they will be in touch i explained that is fine because i'm basically getting on with it and trying to pace myself i had a physical night last night and had to exert myself more in other words i done some work so i rested today will walk home with my daughter after work and see how tonight goes im feeling okay bit tight chest and ear tension which is normal at the moment hopefully these gps start to get you some help stuart soon sarah did say keep pacing and try to get rest as well but also if you need the gp ring them not to get confused with the symptoms because i told her i've got a heavy left hand it could be something else gary ps hope you are all feeling better today",

          "hi res and everyonehow are you feeling now res? hopefully feeling a bit better than over the weekend. i really hope the steroids help you. it is so hard to stay positive when you have felt so unwell for so long - i think we all understand that feeling. sounds like everyone is struggling at the moment. i listened to the longcovid programme on radio 4 yesterday - interesting but sadly no real advice or treatment but at least is has been recognised and is being researched.sorry you are not getting any help from gp stuart - it is so disheartening and as you say it is such a long story to explain the last six months and i always have the feeling gps think it is all in the head and you are making it up - if only. i've given up on mine but sometimes feel maybe should phone to say i am still suffering symptoms so at least i am logged as a longcovid case rather than they assume you are recovered and fine.take care everyone, sending positive energy. lx",
          "stuart you can always switch to another gp practice within your catchment area. i had no gp back in march when i was sick because we'd also moved house. we really weren't sure where to go so i registered myself in one practice and husband and kids at another so we could compare. i remember talking to 1 gp at my new place who happily told me there's nothing to do to help me! eventually i discovered another gp at same surgery who was much more helpful (there was also persistent nagging on my part!) she got me referred to post covid clinic and that has been very helpful. we really should all be with a post covid clinic now.",
          "hi lulu,chest is still tight and feeling pretty crappy. burst into tears in the car today on way home from doc. just feel this is all going on forever and is really getting to me. don't see much light at the end of the tunnel with winter approaching as even in a good year i will usually have bronchitis a couple times and a tonsillitis. always been unlucky with upper respiratory stuff, so kinda worried given that i won't really have the opportunity to recover properly unless i hide away from everyone...and even then, with a kid at primary school that's not very realistic.need to try and keep it in the day though or am going to feel worse. you should def let your doctor know that you have long covid. be counted...they are trying not to count all these numbers i am pretty sure so don't make it easy for them!\ud83d\ude02",

          "i'm the same, lulu and susanreally up and down these last couple of weeks, and not back to where i was before. it must be fatigue with me, i've been watching some videos about it to help me with the pacing, as i'm so useless at it !hope you're feeling better res, and you're having better luck with your doctor, stuartcan't believe this is still going on after so long. must keep positive :)",
          "hi joanne, i totally get you about the pacing. when i have moments of feeling more 'normal' i forget to be careful and start acting as i usually would. it's important to rest even when feeling well it seems. thanks for your words about the doc. i live in hope of us all being understood by our docs one day. some positive news, i purchased a fitwatch thing and i've been able to monitor my heart rate constantly over the last few days via a graph on an app. i've seen my resting heart rate get better progressively which has really helped me feel more positive. i am always a bit worried about reporting positive news as we all know what tends to happen, but i'll take the risk \ud83d\ude01hope you get some better days soon, and that applies to everyone. all the best.",
          "hi jo and everyone!i think it is definitely pacing which helps but it is so hard to do! i only work on thurs/fri so spend mon-weds gallivanting around cramming all my social events into three days and then crash and burn on a thurs/fri, pick up a bit sat/sun and then do exactly the same the following week \ud83d\ude02 going back some months i remember always being ill after prosecco tuesday - i should have worked it out!rang gp this morning, as useless as ever, asked me what medication i was on when i said mucodyne she asked me what it was for? ermm.. the clue is in the name and actually you prescribed it \ud83d\ude44 anyway i logged the whole 7 month drama and said i would like it recorded on my notes as covid 19 as had a clinical diagnosis as no tests available - needless to say she wouldn't do that only suspected covid 19. well at least it is recorded if any treatment or help becomes available in future and i also asked about post covid hubs - \"what's that?\"!! didn't have a clue what i was talking about. no kidding we could all do a much better job caring for covid patients than the average gp (i do know there have been a couple of exceptions).stuart great news about the fitbit - just don't get obsessed with it!! i was at one point but calmed down now but it is good to be able to check if you feel a bit weird/fluttery any time.anyway, have a great weekend everyone, lx",
          "hi everyone :)yes lulu, it seems pacing must be the answer, if we can manage it. i'm trying to recognise the signs that i'm going to crash, and i'll try not to ignore it, and not try to quickly finish what i'm doingthat's great news on hr, stuart, really pleased for you. it was such a relief when my resting one came down, just need to work on the walking up slopes onethese videos i've watched about fatigue are really good. it makes you look at it in a different way, after all we are convalescing, and we should look after ourselves and not feel guilty about not doing things. it also mentions mental and emotional stress being as tiring as the physical, and mentions how exhausting it can be explaining to people that we may look better, but we're not. lots of useful information, they're- advanced wellbeing research fatigue videosenjoy your weekends :)",
          "afternoon guys,woke up feeling rough today. feeling hot one minute then cold the next. guts churning. ive had tingling down my arms and legs too, which i haven't had for weeks, if not months.the world these days is very strange.at least the weather is consistent with autumn. foggy, cold and drizzling. boo.",
          "morning lulu and everyone. it sounds like you have the same gp as me! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02we shouldn't have to wrestle with these people, it's quite bizarre. thanks for the advice re the fitbit. i have been a bit obsessed these first few days and i think it's important not to focus constantly on hr. i have had a pretty bad couple of weeks and seem to have energy levels at zero so i have been using it to make sure i rest. advice taken \ud83d\udc4djoanne, you're right, we are convalescing. if we had a recognised illness with a definite pattern, diagnosis and treatment it would be so much easier. i just can't understand how after all this time i can feel worse than i did 2 months ago. i'm guessing it's because i did too much when i had better days. thanks for the tip re the videos. hope you're all having a good day. take care everyone.",
          "hi jimsorry to hear that! you just never know what you are going to get from one day to next or from one hour to next some days! i am feeling very nasally - the consultant has put allergic rhinitis on letter and seems it is triggered by change in temperature - not very helpful as in this country we can drop 20 degrees up or down in a week!good to see trump's medical entourage seem more switched on than our gps!! - makes you realise how they know how serious this virus is when you see a team of 12/14 doctors looking after one patient - albeit the president!hope you perk up again tomorrow, am sure you will.lx",
          "thanks lulu your words are really appreciated.i now know what has triggered it. stress.",
          "hi stuart,ha! i knew you would get obsessed it's hard not too! i sometimes wear an ordinary watch and it is such a relief - it's like getting a random day off work!hope the hr has settled down generally, it is probably quite variable in normal times but we wouldn't have been so aware pre march. i had no idea what my hr was before this nightmare started. interesting about feeling worse than 2 months ago - just throwing this out there but do you think our expectations are higher now as we are able to do more or do you think you actually feel worse. am not sure what the answer is btw but i question this myself. i definitely think the warmer weather helped me. i am just picking up again after a rough couple of weeks so am determined not to overdo it this coming week!take care,lx",
          "in desperation have just tried the neilmed nasal rinse - will report back if any improvements but it wasn't unpleasant at all and easy to use. had the mucus stuck in back of nose and throat so felt had little to lose! seeing ent consultant again on 13th so at least i can honestly tell him i have tried it!lx",
          "hi lulu, you did make me laugh about the watch giving you a day off \ud83d\ude02you're also spot on about not knowing what our hr was before all this virus malarkey. i have no clue. as for feeling worse now, it's an interesting question you posed. i would say these last 4 weeks i have gone backwards. my breathing is more restricted. i have less energy and i can't walk anywhere near what i was doing say, back in the summer. i don't know if its a bad patch that will correct itself or if it is the damp weather we are now getting or whether i am going down hill because i now have an untreated lung /heart condition. no idea. i expected to see a gradual improvement over the months and i did see that, but now it seems to be in reverse. perhaps i'm going through a period of the body healing itself, hence lower energy. i prefer to think it's that. your rhinitis problems sound very familiar to me. i have the lump and the constant feeling of torrents of mucus at the back of the throat/nose. god knows where it comes from and why, but your diagnosis sounds familiar. you seem to be on a very similar timeline of symptoms as me. what do you think in answer to your own question? are you worse or is it expectation? for me it's both. i think \ud83e\udd14 well done on the nasal rinse by the way. i must get some myself. i have the pot thingy but no sachets. i have suffered with nasal trouble over the years so i've been here before. take it easy lulu. enjoy your evening.",
          "hi stuart and everyoneinteresting to hear what you think about your progress and i'm same i really don't know any more - when i think back to a couple of months ago i think i was coughing a lot more and spitting out mucus (sorry!!) regularly throughout the day and probably had more chest pain than i have now - so maybe it is just the trajectory we are on and it is peaks and troughs but overall in the right direction a bit like the chris witty slides \ud83d\ude02 i do feel that i get more tired than i did but i think that may be that i am doing more and many of my friends have said they feel tired after lockdown - think we have all slowed down. also i do think most people are affected by the weather and a grey, wet sunday is not going to make you feel as good as a warm sunny sunday - anyway who knows?! i just know i do feel quite vulnerable this winter and i hate that feeling - i am not used to being worried about health issues i've always been really hardy!i hate to admit it after all this time of having the neilmed (btw i don't work for them even though i suspect my consultant does\ud83d\ude06) sitting on the side but i think the nasal rinse has actually helped - i rinsed each nostril, sniffed the remainder of the water up my nose, then gave it a good blow - i do feel clearer in the head! in summary, i think my lungs have improved although far from perfect but the nasal stuff has maybe got worse but maybe expected with the heating going on and change of temperature.how is everyone doing? hopefully having a relaxing sunday.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu,finally come round from the stress crash of fridays debacle.your right when it's cold, dark and damp it doesn't make you feel your best.i've had a bash with a neilmed and even though it cleared my nose it was only temporary fix. i've also found my nose sometimes clears of it's own accord! bizarre.i had a flu jab on thursday and no ill effects. due to shortages my gp said it would be december but put me in touch with a local chemist who gives the jab for \u00a315. i wasn't arguing.since i've been on the steroid inhaler my chest mucus has dried. unfortunately, it hasn't done anything for the upper respiratory mucus but it's something.i hope everyone has had a good weekend and fingers crossed this sh1te finishes quickly.jim.",
          "so glad you are feeling better jim, it is a tough time of year at the best of times yet alone after the past six months we have all had to battle through.good news about the flu jab, i am still nervous but think i will end up having it - i have a e-voucher for boots from work (don't ever say they don't give us anything \ud83d\ude02)but can't use it yet.have to say i think the upper respiratory tract mucus is what is causing me most problems now for me too. i am seeing consultant on 13th so will ask more questions and try and get some answers for us.yep think we all deserve a break from this - we have done our time and need some relief. think fair to say we are all worn out by this never ending saga! take care,lx",
          "thanks lulu.my only real problem is the fatigue. it's brought my life to an abrupt halt, which is yet to get going.",
          "morning jim and everyone!agree the fatigue is tough jim but pretty sure that will improve with more time. our bodies have done an amazing job fighting this bastad virus off single handedly with no medical interventions so it is going to be knackered and take time to recover. it has also been totally exhausting mentally, the constant stress and worry of every symptom and twinge with no medical answers - it has been really tough as you know only too well. it is positive news that the mucus has gone from your chest and hopefully only a matter of time for the nasal/throat mucus to clear (that is what i keep telling myself!). do you remember we used to laugh about how symptoms were travelling back up from the lungs - maybe it wasn't such a stupid idea.just done the nasal wash but think was a bit over enthusiastic on my left nostril and now have a sinus type headache which i never normally get - anyway lesson learnt need to be more gentle! i also think the water was a bit too warm!spoke to my son who is in ny at moment and he gave me a big lecture about diet and rest. he eats seriously healthy to the point of being seriously boring but he is right we need our immune system to be in tip top condition especially at the moment so i had a google of all the foods which support the immune system - many of which i eat already but hard as i looked i couldn't find cadbury's giant chocolate buttons on there!! anyway am going to try and cut any rubbish out of diet and go to bed earlier!where's gary?? hope you are ok gary, presumably feeling much better and/or just busy with working - either way hope everything going ok let us know when you get a moment.have a good week everyone.lx",
          "morning everyone well that has been a eye-opener this week has been one of the longest of my life saturday night was just horrible wet and cold and we had a big job on four heavy timber bearers to put in and just me and my mate decided to put them on the trolley together okay at the time but sunday couldn't move the top half of my body was also getting tight chest and head and neck tension thankfully all ok today still getting ear tension and tight chest but i have had to go through the fatigue pacing during the day got lots of housework to catch up with looks like everyone is working on the pacing as well i have a week off now not heard anything from my gp except for the flu jab which they are trying to fit in for november never really worried about winter before because i'm outside most of the time still hoping one of us gets there soon see mr trump caught it never mentioned paracetamol and water for him still taking zinc myself that's it just hoping it will go in time hope everyone has a good week gary",
          "morning lulu,sounds as you have a very sensible son. one to be proud of!totally agree we need to take extra care of ourselves.i've just picked up a new nasal spray, which my gp prescribed after hearing the steroid inhaler had potentially dried my chest mucus. i'll post an update when i've used it for a week or so.have a good day.jim.",
          "morning gary,so glad to hear from you pal.your news is great! managing to do that on nights you should be really chuffed.it's amazing how trump has improved in comparison to our cohort. just goes to prove how much they now know about little sugar.keep improving gary your my target!jim.",
          "morning jim how are you doing mate been a tough few days because i have had the heavy hands and legs i must admit i was a little nervous about the fatigue but i thought if i can get through this week i can rest next time i go in its on days so that will be easier i hope you're stepping up your walking and resting i'm still getting trouble with my breathing little stabbing pains still there i'm hoping it's the healing process jim hope the nasal spray is helping you long time since i took the neil meds mine is just dry walking home with my daughter today seems so much easier than a few weeks ago i'm not going to bother with my gp anymore don't think there is any thing more they can do or give me wish the tight chest would do one with the tension sorry lulu been busy with work your son is exactly right but like you i've never been one for the dieting have to rest or the fatigue will bite just got to get it right with the pacing i've booked five out of my seven nights off next time i'm going to try and get better before i do the next seven i've earned a few beers tonight so i will later last orders at nine so i will have a couple i know we've all got long covid anyone know how long though was telling the bloke i work with how lucky he was on the 20 th march i didn't touch him hope your all having a better monday gary",
          "hi gary,i'm up and down but not in a good way. i have to try to keep reminding myself i've improved.as for the walking, being honest i've been slack but started up again.enjoy your well deserved beers!",
          "i know what you mean its got to a point where we are hoping for time to go and we feel better never ever thought of it that way maybe if 2020 did one and we were all healthy again and could get on with our lives i would take that i will try and enjoy the beer later thank you jim it's actually a nice day here hope you have a good day gary",
          "hi all glad you got your flu jab jim and your ok \u263a\ufe0f i did my sleep in at work thurs night and it was ok but didn't do alot when i finished on fri was shattered by 2pm fri, i'm just trying to rest now when i can which for me is hard work. i'm still getting the sinuses etc and mucas don't think we're ever going to be free of it. i don't think trump has had covid it's all a properganda stunt if he was on oxygen like they say he wouldn't be doing so well? hope you all have a nice day, its sunny down here \ud83c\udf1e\ud83c\udf1e",
          "hi everyone :)sounds like we've all got the fatigue, hopefully it's the final stage and we'll get through it soon. i've had a very up and down week, can't seem to get the pacing right and using up what little energy i have. will have to try harder this weekthanks for updates on neilmed, lulu, i've ordered some, hoping it'll help clear my nose. i seem to still have a lot of mucus, still not sure where it's all coming fromhave a good day everyone",
          "you are doing really well sue. i couldn't do a night shift yet.i am glad i managed to get the flu jab especially as i couldn't via my gp.the nasal mucus is a pain isn't it.",
          "hi garysounds like a really tough week - must be so hard for you doing a physical job but glad you have some time off now to get some rest and relaxation. am so angry where trump has tweeted don't be scared of covid - what an idiot - as you say he might feel differently if he had been told to drink water and take paracetamol and if you can breathe stay at home! i knew he would belittle it - the guy is a joke. all those people who have lost family and friends and those still suffering - really undermines the seriousness of this.anyway just the thought of him makes my hr rise so am going to calm down!!glad you are ok and take it easy.lx",
          "hi joi'm same the days i do less i feel almost normal but then i go and overdo it and realise am still suffering! let me know what you think of the neilmed i've used it in the morning and evening - i would say do it gently until you get hang of it and i definitely squirted it too hard this morning but i love the feeling it definitely clears you out and says on instructions to sniff a few times after and then blow nose hard - it worked for me! hopefully will easy the stuffiness and mucus \ud83e\udd1elx",
          "hi susanwell done on the all nighter - that must be tough but another step in right direction and definitely rest after doing that. have you tried the neilmed sinus rinse - it has made a real difference and is easy to do - it seems to have stopped the lump in the throat mucus feeling - might be worth a try if you haven't already.glad you have enjoyed some sunshine!just told gary my view on trump and it is too early anyway to say you are recovered i felt pretty ok for the first 10/14 days before it really hit - something not right about the whole thing.take care,lx",
          "morning lulu i'm awake early got headache too true trump is a joke probably publicity stunt if he has got it i hope it comes back and kicks his back side had a few pints last night will rest today washing and housework to do hopefully drop back off to sleep now hope everyone has a good day gary",
          "just read an article on google from the bbc on long covid it has a chart on it as well all the different symptoms looks like we've been the unlucky ones which we knew all along worth having a read everyone gary",
          "morning gary,you're up bright and early pal.did you enjoy your beers?i've just read the bbc article and we're definitely the unlucky ones. there didn't seem to be any answers nor signs they've any ideas about the covid virus.well, now they've acknowledged long covid they need to press on and start looking for answers!just finished steaming my head.have a good day.jim.",
          "morning jim i did enjoy the beers what i am trying to do is just get on with it now like i did before i got it so i know i'm not going to get much help and i'm not even sure they know what to do to help we've all helped each other to get where we are i can work and do all the things i used to do except i have to pace myself i'm hoping the tight chest and ear tension and headaches will go on their own as they have eased the one thing i did notice is i have to drink more water when i'm working i am a lot drier mouth wise happy steaming jim try and have a good day gary",
          "thanks for advice on neilmed, lulu, looking forward to using it, have to study instructions. i've got the squirty bottle, is that what you've got?are you still avoiding citrus fruits cos of reflux? i was really missing them so i had a couple of little oranges yesterday, but i don't think my stomach was too keen. it's a shame we're not supposed to have the things that fight colds like citrus fruits, garlic, onions. i do have some tomato on my pizza though!i've read the bbc article, gary, seems they're starting to be interested in us a bit now, but we won't get any help. i'm still trying to work it all out for myself. i had a little consultation with myself today to decide what to do. resting doesn't suit me so when i'm tired i shall potter!has trump really had it? how can he be recovered already, and if so, hope everyone else can have all that medication that he was givenenjoy your evenings everyone :)",
          "hi joyes i've got the squirty bottle! it has definitely helped with my blocked nose and mucus/lump in throat. i eat a large handful of blueberries every morning and always have a kiwi fruit (apparently they have twice the vit c of an orange and twice the nutrients of an apple!) i then have a boiled egg with a slice of marmite on toast! so yes still eating fruit as i really like it and also still eat lots of tomatoes - i also eat half a bag of organic spinach most nights i stir fry it in olive oil and garlic - its delicious and really quick. my friend sent me the article gary mentioned, seems there is a lot in the news now which is good for us - annoying though boris has denied having longcovid - think it is pretty obvious he has but is protecting himself and his job by denying it - you can see he is still not well.i think trump has had it and probably still has it - been pumped full of steroids reckon he will crash and burn in next few days - not that i would wish that on anyone but be surprised if he doesn't.take care, hope the neilmed helps you.lx",
          "hi gary and everyonehope you caught another couple of hours sleep - as i said to jo reckon he has had it but definitely not out of the woods yet. i am still getting tight chest - had to finish clearing my mum's flat today so was up and down stairs etc. and chest tightness came - if i am just pottering around or even walking up hill i don't seem to get it - if i am darting around and maybe feeling a bit stressed it comes on - makes me realise i am still definitely nowhere near right - very depressing. anyway resting this afternoon. i am same as you doing everything i'd normally do but never quite sure what is going to trigger the symptoms and how i will feel from day to day.i know you are done with your gp and just getting on with it, i feel same, but i did ring mine friday and basically told her i want it recorded on my records that i have had c19 and 7 months later i am still unwell and then listed symptoms - just think it is good to have it recorded on your medical notes as we don't know what is going to happen in future and if any treatment we want to be eligible. don't want them saying well we didn't hear from you since june or whenever so you must have recovered. i will ring again before christmas if still not 100% so they know. despite telling her testing wasn't available in march and having a clinical diagnosis from ct scan she would only put suspected covid. in some ways that suits me as not sure it is good if you want medical/travel insurance etc. in future to have had a formal diagnosis by testing. if it suits us when completing forms we can say we didn't have it - i am sure it is a question which will soon be on medical forms. the uncertainty of not being tested works both ways.sometimes i think we are the unlucky ones but then other times i think perhaps we have been lucky - depends how i feel on the day!take care,lx",
          "hi lulu i feel like the tight chest is easing but like you said it comes back with a vengeance i really felt it saturday night but sunday was fine i'm getting the tension a lot but i can deal with it even though i know it is there sarah the woman who is a speech and throat specialist has my notes and knows i have long covid i'm pretty sure she has sent a letter to my gp thats where it stopped maybe they have a backlog i'm not sure but i still don't think they are going to do anything for me i can manage most things had a bad case of the two bob bits the last couple of days could blame the beer enjoy your evening gary",
          "i know what you mean joanne it's probably best if we try to work it out for ourselves but it is a tough one to call because it is still giving us these problems after all this time even though i feel i can manage it i would still like to have an inclination to when it will stop if someone could tell me that i would be over the bloody moon gary",
          "nothing worse than a case of the two bob bits \ud83d\ude02 my doc told me that they think c19 may affect lining of stomach which causes gi problems and also the reflux problems everyone seems to have acquired since march or as you say may be just too much beer \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02are you still coughing at all? how about sore throat has that completely gone now?lx",
          "no coughing never really had that sore throat seems okay but that can change i'm only now getting head and ears tension tight chest did have heavy hands and legs but that has also eased except my left hand tingling a lot but i can deal with it every fepsw days i get that sickly feeling for like half an hour before it goes gary ps also tension across the neck",
          "you eat healthily, lulu, i love the sound of that spinach, sounds delicious, i'll have to try it. i'm eating loads of fruit too, but maybe not citrus just yet, i'm having grapes and melon, ooh i forgot about kiwi, have to put them on the listyes, gary, we just need to know the date it's all going to end, now!",
          "afternoon everyone not done a lot today was just basically chilling when i was thinking about the situation we are all in well surely the experts must have some sort of information now about long term covid and what we should be doing i understand about the pacing and fatigue and everything else we all do but what about getting better or do we have to try to live with it till it goes i'm not sure if i ring my gp they will be able to answer me does it stop when the tight chest goes i'm still getting sharp pains in my back that come and go if i went and asked someone at a and e would they know i could ask sarah but she deals with speech and throat issues etc or as i said before stop moaning and get on with it? gary",
          "hi garyi don't think you'd get any answers from anyone, they really don't know. i'm getting back pains too, is it my back, lungs, related to stomach? who knows, haven't a clue. as you say, maybe just get on with it, unless it's really bad of course. i still think these new/returning symptoms could be caused by the change in weather.hope it eases off for you soon",
          "hi joanne i don't think it is to do with the change in the weather i work outside and i have never bothered about it before your right about they haven't got a clue but i thought because it's been over 6 months maybe the experts would have spoken to maybe the chinese italians or the spanish and sussed out a little bit about why it hasn't left us like it's our immune system or we got a bigger dose of it which may be still lurking in our system or some drug that will help us or it will just go in time or what damage it is doing will the fatigue go etc i know i have to get on with it and i will would be nice to know if or when there is a chance i will get better right now i'm going to sink a few pints see if that helps \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "good evening my covid buddies. as a lot of you have said now that we've all reached the 6 month mark, it would be nice to know when this nightmare will end !! it's such a comfort to know that we're all not suffering alone. jim i hope work goes ok, is it your first week back ? i'm having a few work issues but am being proactive and putting my health and wellbeing first. i'm going to speak to my gp maybe next week to ask if there's any help out there, i can only but try !! enjoy your evenings everyone",
          "hi steph,yes, it's been week one back. work dropped off a laptop and i've done very little bar email and admin jobs.being honest i can't see me being able to return to my usual job but there's a few months before that would be implied by work.come march if we're still suffering with symptoms it'll be classed as a disability. yikes!hope your well.jim.",
          "hi jim, everyone let's hope by march we're all ok...and while we're hoping let's also hope the world will be doing better then too!someone asked me yesterday how i am and i was able to say i'm so much better than i was and then she asked are you back to your old self completely and i said, that i'm not! i am able to do pretty much everything but i do need a lot more rest to help function well, like a nap in the day if i've not had 8-10 hours sleep at night. otherwise i feel unwell. reflux seems to be settling. still with the odd muscle pain which isn't terrible. eye trouble i still have though. in fact, had a bit of a moment when i was driving down the m1 and my right eye started to sting badly and water, literally had to drive while squinting!did loads of walking today and realised it was just too much. find i do much better on days that use much less exercise.seen long covid in the news a lot lately and sounds like they will actually be doing something about it!hope you've all had a good day!",
          "morning guys,what a horrid day. the weather is awful.i woke up this morning to the sound of rain bouncing down. as now is the norm, i'd dreamt all night strange things. pre covid i never really dreamt.as i laid in bed, i started to think of what it was like to wake with energy, a list of things to do without any concern and not having the internal reverberations.unfortunately, groundhog day has reset yet again.well enough if the negativity, time to get a grip and get on with it. sorry for being down. sometimes it just comes over me.hope everyone has a good day.jim.",
          "morning jim and everyone i had the same sort of day yesterday not any different to many other days just was like thinking if there was anyone who knows if we are near the finish line or got any ideas it's got to the point where i can deal with it if i don't over do it gave my oximeter to a friend yesterday don't use it anymore and she has just lost her sister who lives in canada so she was all over the place trying to work out how to get there etc weather not too great here either jim hope you pick up today gary",
          "hi gary,i'm sorry to hear of your friends news. what a terrible year it's been.as for whether we're near the end pal, i've no idea. however, following your advice i'm trying to do more and remain positive. obviously, it's easier said than done.as someone has previously said there is much more knowledge of our plight and we've been mentioned more in the press and on tv.i think it'll be a long time before they find anything for us, so we need to soldier on.alcohol definitely helps.be good,jim.",
          "yes i think you are right jim just have to crack on with it and become an alcoholic on my days off and just try and work out a way to make it work so it's easier 6pints a night might do it just gotta deal with the two bob bits in the morning \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "sounds like a plan pal!!!",
          "morning guys,a change of medication yesterday and as a result i've been awake since three.back to the old medication tonight i think.have a good day.jim.",
          "oh dear jim. \ud83d\ude33you must be exhausted.was this from the gp?",
          "sorry to hear that jim - every day is a challenge in a different way! i fluctuate between chest issues and sore throat - it is either/or most days!!yep if only we knew if this is ever going to end. i have to keep telling myself that i am very slowly improving - i think you need to look back over several weeks to see the improvement. it is six weeks since i was away with my son and even though i have had many bad days i do think overall i have improved - less mucus, less coughing. have a power nap (apparently no more than 20 mins!) and hopefully sleep well tonight.lx",
          "really have to look at it like that, across a number of weeks, even a month to see there is actual improvement.i'm not feeling good \u2639 clearest sign that i'm not back to myself however great i've been feeling recently. and i know exactly what's brought it on. chessington world of adventures on wed with the kids who were off school and i'm paying for it since! i am fine doing the regular day routine but this was too much for me. feeling so fatigued, nauseous, muscle aches, headache today, having to take breaks after everything!",
          "afternoon dane and everyone that's all it takes still bet the kids loved it i also knew that i had overdone it after the week of nights i have time off till sunday then i go back to work on days which are easy still have to pace though i've actually cut down on a lot of the normal stuff just do what i have to once the tight chest goes i will try to step it back up again and see what happens got the usual ear tension tight chest and heavy hands and legs but feeling fine just like everyone else wondering what is next hope everyone has a good evening gary",
          "hi all i've been decorating this week in between work and child minding last couple days been feeling tired been over doing it need to remember haven't been well for 6months. still getting odd cough, feeling like cold coming, sinuses but like u all we have to battle through \u2639\ufe0f\ud83e\udd12 do feel livelier when sun shining tho! it could be weather related. it concerning that its spiking again brighton is the worse around here i do worry we're get it again but try not to think about it. trump is a joke he really isn't all there a dangerous man, i think it's a publicity stunt you can't be on oxygen one minute then be ok the next day. hope your all well \u2764\ufe0f",
          "hi susan & everyonesounds like you've been very busy!! it is so good though you have managed to do so much. i do think the weather affects most people regardless of covid - we could have done with another few months of sunshine to get over these last symptoms - i am same worry about getting it again but try not to go down that road - it is out of our control to some degree and just have to follow the guidelines, use common sense and hope for the best!have had a pretty good few days but am always aware that my throat and breathing is not right just have to hope it continues to improve. had an on/off sore throat but am seeing ent guy on tuesday if anyone has any questions - got a feeling we have asked all the questions we can think of over the last 7 months but let me know!! - he is very chatty and seems to know a lot about what is going on with c19 and research so will report back.take care everyone, hope you all have a a great weekend without too many symptoms.lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've got some good news for once i start back on days today so up early my stomach is going mad but the good news is most of the tension seems to have gone from my head and ears getting some across my shoulders also the tight chest is easing daily still there hopefully after this week of days it goes who knows i just got probably the same question lulu any danger he knows how much longer it will be with us if we just get on with it hope you all have a good sunday gary",
          "hey gary and everyone!good news things improving for you. surely things must settle completely soon just think main thing is to try and avoid catching anything else, even a cold, every week we avoid is another week we are healing. will ask him but if i had to hazard a guess he will say a year to fully recover (think they've had to rethink the 6 months originally stated!) which is fine so long as we keep moving in right direction.hope your week of days goes well and you can see improvement from last time. enjoy your day everyone! just off out for a long walk in the forest hopefully in the sun.lx",
          "that's fine lulu i would rather know i know each day i'm feeling better some days it hits me for a bit then goes the headaches and earaches were there for quite a while only slight tension now and again may be a year hope not but it could be worse we could be one of those just getting it enjoy yourself walking suns shining here as well gary",
          "such good news you are noticing a real improvement gary. i felt pretty good today did long walk 4.5 miles climbed 28 flights (according to my watch) and breathing was good but then this afternoon chest feels tight - it is just easing off now - what causes that??! my son, who i saw wednesday, luckily outside and socially distanced, received a text from work today to say one of the girls he works with has tested positive and they should all isolate for two weeks and wfh. what an utter nightmare, it is never ending. it has so many implications as he was away last weekend with friends, he has a g/f, he has flat mate - had to let them all know. hopefully he will be fine, he doesn't have any symptoms. i feel sorry for everyone but think it is tough for the youngsters, especially the ones who are trying to follow guidelines and are concerned about their parents/friends but also need to get on with their jobs/lives.lx",
          "hi lulu i think it's just a time thing with it a long time but i think we will all get there i'm only worried about the fatigue i wish i knew if i could push it i will do the day's and couple of nights then i'm going to push myself to the limits and see what happens if i break down or fatigue gets me then i will know i have to take it easy but sooner or later we have to go for it gary",
          "hi everyone :)that's good symptoms are improving, hopefully for everyonea year is ok, so long as we can see the gradual improvements, and it all ends therei'm still working on the pacing, trying not to have any more setbacks, hopefully. it's the fatigue mostly getting me, i seem to get tired easily with physical stuff like walking, after 20-30 minslulu, i'm finding neilmed really helpful, thanks for recommending it. it's a weird sensation though, like swimming underwater when you get water up your nose. it clears everything, i must have a lot of inflammation as there's loads of it!hope everyone enjoyed the sun today(if you had it)",
          "hi all hope everyone feeling ok today sun's been shinning been out walking with my clients and sitting outside having coffee today at work, so a nice shift. i really hope we all stay well and safe this time round.",
          "same jo. it's the fatigue, really feeling it after i exert myself. i'm also starting to realise what fatigue symptoms for me are, aside from obvious tiredness because i noticed my eyes will sting more and i feel nauseous. had it today so went to lie down and completely conked out for 1.5 hours!did enjoy the sun today though!",
          "hi jo and everyone i'm same with the tiredness but just sit around a lot in between doing walks etc. im lucky my partner does a lot around house and have a cleaner so not much domestics for me these days! must be so hard if you have family to look after whilst trying to pace - that must be tough! so glad the neilmed has helped i love it do it every morning really clears you out wish id taken consultants advice and used it when he first suggested it.sounds like you had a good shift susan and the weather makes such a difference.my eyes are red in morning dane but settle during day. have to say feel generally quite rough first thing when i wake up!here's to a good week ahead everyone!lx",
          "afternoon lulu and everyone i'm finding everyday that the tight chest is easing more if i have to do lots of work what i'm finding is the hand and legs are heavy and i get head tension but when i rest it eases i'm resting at the moment got a nice day tomorrow just walking a few miles my breathing just gets a bit heavier when i push it but do feel a lot better these last few days i'm hoping everyone else is i still get the traffic light eyes now don't know why weird gary",
          "hi gary and everyonethat is good news about the tight chest!! i feel overall my chest and breathing is better than it was. i also generally feel better in myself but who knows if it will last?! we should be feeling more consistently better gary we are about 7 months in \ud83d\ude32 i still have a bit of a cough especially in the morning and at night - anyone else still coughing? not sure if this is coming from the mucus in throat or from lungs will ask when i see the ent guy tonight.if there is any groundbreaking news to report back on from this evening will let you know but my bet is there won't be!! it will be give it time \ud83d\ude44take care,lx",
          "hi lulu no like you i feel i am improving daily but it is slowly the thing i did notice is i'm not getting the horrible feeling i was getting like i feel ill for a while and it goes still little tension heavy hands and legs little mucus and tight chest but i know that is easing i have three days left to do this week then two nights next week then i will have a bike ride and see if i can push myself gary",
          "hi lulu, gary and everyone,good luck with your appointment. i can't think of anything that you won't already be asking. gary good news you're doing so well pal.had a little cough this morning, bit of a sore throat/lump. felt run down and tired today. my arms felt like i'd been to the gym. coughed up some green mucus after steaming this morning. hopefully that was from my nose rather than coming up from my lungs. i haven't coughed mucus like that for months.weather wise its horrible up here. this morning was sunshine but since 11 its thrown it down.back to the tv fir me.jim.",
          "hi jimif it is any consolation it is chucking it down here too - really miserable. when i cough it feels quite \"raspy\" but i suppose over a long period of time it has slowly improved but would like it to go away completely - never had a cough before all this! i will ask about where he thinks the mucus is coming from - he will no doubt do an endoscopy thing so will be able to see what is going on at back of nose/throat.will report back later!lx",
          "i'm same gary and it is good not to be having that cycle of keep feeling ill and then it goes and comes back again - maybe that is our immune system adjusting back to normal (just a thought!). i'm feeling positive today, we will be better just a little way to go now. don't forget we still need to crack open that fizz but we have to be sure we are better before we do that!lx",
          "of course lulu and if everyone still wants to would be nice to meet for a everyone better drink lol gary",
          "hi everyoneconsultant was pleased did an endoscopy and said the inflammation was improved from last time showed me on a photo chart of red/inflamed throats and mine originally was severe and now moderate/mild. he asked about other symptoms and said the fact they are improving, albeit slowly, means they will continue to improve - will just get better and better. he said don't fall down the long covid rabbit hole - it is not good mentally to label yourself - it is just a long drawn out recovery but you will recover. it can happen with other viruses. glandular fever, shingles etc. he said to continue with the steaming, neilmed nasal rinse, drink plenty of water, thought the mucus was from nose/throat although was better than before. he said to try and stop focussing on the illness and just get on with your life - go out, go swimming, go walking - when you are tired rest etc! basically chill out - stress will make everything much worse.anyway seeing him again beginning of december. hope it is reassuring for everyone.lx",
          "yet again lulu you've done our little cohort a great service.on behalf of everyone, i thank you for the update.",
          "thanks so much for sharing lulu, that's really positive news for us and great advice.:)",
          "thanks lulu that's great news he is exactly right i have been trying to do exactly that i try hard to not mention it now some friends do ask me and i answer honestly but i feel it will be ok for us all sooner or later gary",
          "great lulu, so good he could see an actual improvement!i am also trying not too let idea of long covid get in the way of doing what i want. just trying to manage the fatigue as it helps if i know my limits.i've an appointment for an echo in november but that's all for now.keep up the improvements everyone!",
          "hi everyone, thanks for feeding back to us lulu you're a star !! gary i'll be up for meeting up when we're all better, would be nice putting faces to names. i spoke to my gp yesterday and she said we really need to get the congestion sorted, she seemed really concerned and has prescribed me betnesol it's steroid nasal drops to take for a month. if not better then she'll prescribe me steroid tablets. i'm a bit nervous about tablets so really hope the drops help. 1st day of taking so i'll feed back everyone.",
          "hi lulu that's good and positive hope everyone is improving \ud83d\udc96",
          "hi all my think i'm getting a cold feel crap it's just come on this evening \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27 my daughter had head cold last week and i have my grandson on monday and his got a cold today as well. work will send me for a test.",
          "hi susanit may pass i have felt like i've had a head cold all day today but it has worn off a bit this evening - i get this quite frequently where it comes and goes. the temperature has dropped today so possibly that but always safest to be checked and assume you need to be because of work but sounds like worse case scenario it is \"just\" a cold and sure you will be fine. we are not babysitting at moment as they are just little germ bags at this time of year and pick up everything from school/nursery! have booked flu jab for next weds so a bit worried about that!let us know how you get on and how you are feeling tomorrow.lx",
          "let us know how you get on with the nasal drops steph - hopefully they will make a difference. we'll all be phoning up gp for some!lx",
          "hi dane,yep am def not going down the long covid route am just thinking it will take a bit more time but things are improving - it seems to be two steps forward and one back but we will all get there. we have come a long way since march. hope you are doing ok and be good to get the echo done in november - better late than never for all these tests. lx",
          "you have been great with just getting on with it gary - no-one bothers asking me any more they just assume after 7 months must be better!hope all ok with you and you've had a good week at work.lx",
          "hope all ok with you jim, how are you doing? are you feeling better?bit depressing we have gone into tier 2 lockdown - i will be back to tuesday prosecco on the green at this rate! what a complete nightmare this is just can't see an end to it.lx",
          "yep it was positive news jo, hope you are doing well and have had a good week. i think talking to a medical professional, even if they can't give you anything, gives a real boost and fills you will optimism. he was very upbeat and didn't seem worried - was kind of saying its not that unusual after a virus to be unwell for a long period. just remembered my auntie had shingles and was really ill for about 18 months so that is probably what he means. she did get better!lx",
          "hi lulu,i'm not bad. it's the fatigue that is the problem. my gp says it's a time thing.all we can do is wait and see. if my mum was alive she'd tell you i never liked surprises!you're sounding chipper, which is good.sue,hope you're okay.",
          "hi lulu and everyone yes i have been just getting on with it and work it's the fatigue i'm worried about i have a little tight chest now and again been tired today but should be an easy day tomorrow then a couple of days off would be great steph one day if we could all meet up somewhere and have a drink together hopefully when the more than six thing does one with the little sugar i think we need to move pages again just in case stuart can't find us hope you can and your feeling better gary",
          "hi lulu,i'm ok thank you. fatigue is what i have mainly but it's not as crushing as it used to be and i'm keeping very busy so it's in the background now.had the flu jab today, so far so good, just muscle in arm a bit achy which is normal.yes it is better late than never with the echo! getting heart palpitations a bit so want it checked if only to reassure.i think plans to meet anyone now is going to be a challenge considering the almost incessant rain!i'm actually relieved for tighter restrictions as clearly govt hasn't got things under control \ud83d\ude44",
          "hi lulu hope the jab ok i've had mine and no problems, it's hard i have my grandson every monday as my daughter works and at a school lol not much hope for me. i'll let u know later how i am ok at mo so going to work, don't think having to wear a mask all day helps.",
          "hi jim felt like i've got a head cold but no other syptoms but wearing mask all day at work which dosnt help. how r u doing now r u on lock down? they r in burnley.",
          "morning sue,we're tier two whatever that means.people up here have been so blaise about it all since the initial lockdown was raised it's not surprising.i've found it's mainly the under 30's that don't seem to be bothered.young and invincible and being honest i was the same at that age.it's only our current predicament that's changed me.hooe everyone has a good day.jim.",
          "i'm ok thanks, lulu, having a bit better week. i'm trying to rest when i'm tired, and to recognise the signs, instead of ignoring them. we all seem to have these cold symptoms and the fatigue, hope they go away soon.we're on tier 2 here in the midlands, i haven't been able to work these last few weeks as i work with children in their homes. it would be lovely to meet up, but i don't think i'd be able to as it's a bit far for me. i'll certainly drink to our recovery though, soon hopefully. :)",
          "hi jo and everyone!had a good day today met a friend and went for a long walk and pub lunch - we managed to sit outside although it was a bit chilly after 3 hours! we are on tier 2 so can't meet inside house but as dane said think i feel better when there are more restrictions and hope people follow the guidelines - things seem out of control at moment. just had letter from consultant to my gp and he says amongst other things \"anxiety plays a big part in reflux symptoms and is not helped by the current covid 19 situation\" - not sure how i feel about that - hope he is not implying it is anxiety! its very easy when you don't know how to treat something to put it down to anxiety.as jim says everyone blaise about c19, especially the youngsters, if your life or someone close to you have not been affected by it - i always think ask kate garraway if any doubt about the seriousness of this virus and hear what she has to tell you about it - such a sad story and her husband will not be the only one battling in icu since march - people need to wake up to how it doesn't discriminate, being young and fit is no guarantee you won't be affected badly.off to have a large glass of wine and relax for the weekend, hope everyone had a good week and great weekend, hope things continue to improve for everyone.take care,lx",
          "lulu,we all need to live our lives to the maximum we can, whatever our current position is.i've had lunch with a close pal today and done bits and bobs. if i can't do anything tomorrow, well that's how it is. i can't change anything.just about to finish a bottle of a rather splendid shiraz.enjoy your wine.i hope everyone has a lovely weekend.jim.",
          "morning jim and everyone you have it exactly right we are still all in recovery and have to try and live our lives best we can but i will always be forever grateful to res and everyone else on here because you all brought me through a few months where i honestly thought i wouldn't make it especially at the start when i didn't have the symptoms that the so called experts were talking about flu like symptoms possible covid i shall never forget that i hope everyone has a good weekend gary",
          "gary,i agree wholeheartedly with your sentiments. there's no way i'd have made through this far without everyone's help and support on the forum.i can honestly say i was at the very bottom both physically and mentally.",
          "yes jim now let's try and push on and hopefully get rid of all the symptoms that we have hope you enjoyed your shiraz and lulu the wine i will participate in a few pints tonight enjoy whatever your up to gary",
          "i echo everything you say gary and jim about res starting the forum and everyone supporting us on here. you've been just the medicine a lot of us have needed in our hour of need !! enjoy your weekends everyone.",

          "hi gary & everyoneyep it seems that even when you don't have the symptoms they are lurking just below the surface - i never seem to get all the lingering symptoms at once thankfully but they can alternate and change throughout the day. have noticed the sore throat can literally come and go by the hour - its all very weird! overall think the fatigue is easing now. supposed to be a nice day thurs gary so will be good to get on the bike and give you an idea of any improvement since last time.sorry to hear you have a cold jim, exactly what you don't need but take it easy, try not to worry. kiwi fruit have loads of vit c and easy to eat - they are better than oranges - stock up on those and some blueberries if you don't have these already.let us know how you are feeling tomorrow.take care everyone,lx",

          "i agree i think talking makes throat sore - consultant told me it was my voice box which was inflamed so makes sense - just wonder how can still be inflamed 7 months later?! good in a way though that you have increased hours a step nearer normality!yes i need to do same jim, i read too many articles and go on twitter and it can really affect how you feel. back in april i had to boycott news completely and deleted all the apps off my phone - definitely was the right thing to do. yes saw your region were going into tier 3 definitely think the right move - i'd be happy if they locked the whole country down again but understand how businesses feel very differently. there is no answer, either protect people's health or businesses - very hard to do both. think the gov are in a no win situation.i can no longer visit my mum, very sad as she doesn't understand why - feel like i have deserted her in her hour of need but nothing i can do. back from flu jab, told the pharmacist about long covid - she asked what my immune system was like?!! i felt like saying if anything like rest of my body it's probably totally f***** - how the hell would i know what my immune system is doing?! she said jab may not be as effective if my immune system not functioning properly - oh well - whatever!! lx",

          "absolutely agree jim, after all the gov have been banging on about mild flu for the last 7 months no-one round here cares and it is the same in our shops people look at me like i'm mad - the problem is for many it is mild but no-one knows who will be the lucky ones and who won't - it is like russian roulette! glad your appointment was helpful and hope the nasal rinse works. i have a constant sore throat at moment but have to say think the mucus has improved in back of throat but who knows how long that will last for?! have had quite a bit of congestion on chest this week - feel very weary with it all \ud83d\ude22. good news is flu jab seems ok, was hoping it might be a miracle cure but seems not!take care,lx",
          "good news about the flu jab.hows the fatigue?",
          "i still feel very tired but it is not that all consuming fatigue which i had a few weeks ago - overall i do still feel making really slow progress - i don't seem to have that constant head cold feeling any more. it just seems that never get a whole day symptom free, if the sore throat goes then the mucus comes back, if the mucus and sore throat go, the shortness of breath comes back - it's just so frustrating.do you still feel you are making progress or hit a plateau?lx",
          "very hard to say whether i'm making progress to be honest. my pal says i have, which is a positive especially as he's someone that only sees me one a fortnight.however, i'm not sure i am. in my eyes if there is an increment it is slight.id i could shake the fatigue i'd be ecstatic.",
          "agree, it is so hard to tell as differs from day to day for me but think the overall trajectory is in the right direction. it's good your friend can see the progress - we need positive people around us. i am nowhere near back to energy levels i had but as i said think slowly improving - just wish i could sort my mucus, sore throat and chest out - its been particularly bad last few days lots of chest pain which makes me anxious. i think it is when the mucus builds up. hope everyone has a good weekend :-)lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone well just morning went out on bike yesterday only a couple of miles it's still not normal but like you say lulu improving my throat is ok might have been talking too much i've been coughing though i didn't really have a problem with that before my chest is easing daily i would say that the shoulder and neck are weird not pain but feels like i've done something when i know i haven't sounds like the same with yours lulu i don't think it's the yoga we need another full lock down i'm hoping none of my friends or family catch it gary",
          "hi gary,nice to hear from you pal.i'm impressed you got out on your push bike. even a couple of miles us something.yesterday, i managed to wash my car, which was the first time since march. this will sound sad but i usually wash it every 4 or 5 days. didn't do the full monty, as normal but it's clean on the outside.today i've a sore throat, hoarse voice and feel cold. nothing really.hope everyone has a good weekend.",
          "that's great jim because even though you never done the full monty you cleaned it i'm trying to be normal work and live still pace just hoping more than anything the fatigue will go my job is easy at the moment we now can go in do our work and go home i'm off till next week anyway keep improving jim next week finish your car off if you've got the energy suns out here i'm going to walk my kids dog after my daughter finishes work only about a mile i'm going to have a few beers later before we get locked up as well gary",
          "good idea gary.my car will be back to it's usual cleanliness by monday.i've just done my walk. only 0.8 of a mile but in 18 minutes. i don't have to breath through my mouth just my nose, so it's not bad at the moment.i've work at 4 but i'm finished at 8, so i'll join you in a few g&t's.",
          "good on you jim we have suffered a great deal and we are still but we have to try to get back to normal i'm hoping i will have the flu jab next month just in case no side effects for anyone so it won't worry me enjoy your evening gary",

          "morning jim and everyone, glad to hear you're all feeling better and hopefully things are heading in the right direction. i've been taking the steroid drops for nearly 2 weeks but still feeling the congestion, so not sure it's working. i've got another 2 weeks and then it'll be the tablets the doctor said. glad the flu jab's been ok , i'll ask my doctor about having it when i speak to her. hope you all have a fab weekend !!",
          "hi steph and everyonedisappointing the steroid drops haven't worked yet steph but maybe they'll kick in over next couple of weeks these things normally take a bit of time - i've had really bad congestion on chest and soreness and tightness since thurs (same day that my sore throat stopped!!) - it really makes me feel nervous. i have to cough and that clears it a bit but comes back. did a couple of long walks end of last week but think going to knock those on the head for a while and see if it improves. the university college hospital london (uchl) have a post covid clinic which was featured on the news - i've emailed my respiratory consultant to see if he can refer me - was going to ask the gp but decided that would be a waste of time. just feel this has been going on too long and all well and good seeing ent guy and respiratory guy but they only look at the symptoms they specialise in and not the whole/bigger picture and how the symptoms are linked.how's everyone else doing? anyone else still got chest issues and tightness? i actually felt quite unwell friday but don't think was anything to do with flu jab think just coincidence as same symptoms as have been having since march.hope everyone had a good weekend - glad you got out on your bike gary must've made you feel good, and jim cleaned his car (not sure i've ever cleaned a car!) good news you are feeling better susan after the cold.take care,lx",

          "morning lulu and everyone, yes the sun is shining gary lovely to see even if some of us are working. just to say the congestion has felt better the last few days so don't know if the drops have helped ?? ears, nose and throat feel better. happy monday everyone, hope you all have a good week.",

          "i can't believe my upper back pain is back. came on yesterday evening while sitting at the table. it is very achy and is making me anxious because i haven't felt like this in months! feel like i've gone 2 steps back \ud83d\ude2d left a message with the gp, hopefully she'll call tomorrow. i'm about to go right back into work after furlough and though didn't feel perfect was ok. today i can't do much without taking a break and wondering what on earth this means? it is so hard to accept that you can be fine one minute and not the next! after all these months! think we've all done our fair share of symptoms now.sorry for the big moan...hope the rest of you are faring better.good to hear congestion has eased steph. and good luck with the hair cut gary.lulu, jim, sue hope you're ok.",
          "i know dane it's not good i had a spell where i was getting the stabbing pain that has passed thought the sore throat had returned thankfully not probably talking too much i've just read an article from my phone on google news i don't watch the normal news anyway the first woman to get the virus in this country was from essex and she got it in january and has had to go back to work but is still getting symptoms similar to all of us i'm not sure what we can do now except get on with it i don't take any medication now only zinc for my immune system i really don't think anything works i'm beginning to sound down now when i'm not i will have the flu jab next month just been told one of the young lads from work is self isolating including me that's four from my department had it now gary",
          "seems no end in sight. also where i am there's been lots of community cases.on a positive note, gp got back to me very quick (not the gp i wanted but still had little expectation for quick response). he doesn't think backache anything to be concerned about. plus went on with the usual...it's so new no one really knows...can't help feeling annoyed when they say that!",
          "hi all glad i'm over my cold now without 2 many effects, just a bit puffy at times and nose, ear sinuses i'm off now for 2 weeks so can relax, there's been 3 staff tested positive for covid in obe of our profound residential houses bit of a worry but i don't work with them, we get tested in couple weeks. hope every one is no worse. i still give myself 9 1/2. lol jim will get car clean think illl pay to get it done tho.",
          "evening everyone,sorry to hear that dane, it is just so weird how the symptoms just come from nowhere - i'm the same definitely taken a big step back but not sure what to do - i feel really congested and keep getting chest tightness and then when trying to clear chest my throat gets sore - have to say hit a bit of an all time low friday evening - lots of tears (very unlike me) but just so worn out with feeling rubbish and knowing that my lungs are not right - i feel mentally and physically exhausted with it all. i am sure i feel worse now than i did a couple of months ago - how can you still have all these symptoms nearly 8 months later? i have begun to think maybe am just stuck with it just can't see how it will improve after all this time. i remember stuart saying that he had a major setback and understand where he was coming from now. i think about ringing gp but just feels like a waste of breath - as you say they just fob you off with this is a new virus and it takes time, anxiety etc. etc. but who do you turn to for help- i've really no idea.glad you are over the cold susan that is really good news and also you now have time off and will be tested regularly. hope everyone else doing ok and also sorry for the moan!!lx",
          "sorry lulu \u2639 it's awful and physically and mentally draining as you say. i've been really down today. i think we all expected that by now, even if we had setbacks, they'd be small and we would be nearly back to our old selves. in normal times, we would at least have support from family and friends, going out etc. which we really need. now, it's almost winter, we can't socialise easily, there's all these restrictions and it doesn't help lift the spirits.let's hope things better.",
          "thanks dane, you too hope tomorrow is a better day. i think the cold, damp weather not helping.lx",
          "sending positive thoughts to everyone, we can get through these setbacks, it will end soon, we're nearly there, don't forget how far we've come :)",
          "morning all i had a good day yesterday apart from the ringing in my ears most of the day its raining here looks like a horrible winter day hope your right joanne i do know it's been one hell of a slog for us half term so going to see kids if they are out of bed i know what you mean about the doctors dane i just look at the letter flu like symptoms and laugh they use the anxiety one lulu because they don't know what to do i had that one the last time i went to the hospital long time ago now not even sure if they have progressed a lot since if people are still getting long covid now how will they be able to help gary",
          "thanks for the positive vibes jo definitely need those! i feel that if i could lie on a hot sunny beach and swim in the sea it might help - but not to be this year! did think of going away but it is the airport/flight which would stop me.yep its a miserable day here gary, have a nice time with your kids as you say if they are out of bed! slept in spare bedroom last night which is cooler and seems to have helped - don't think the central heating is helping the breathing!take care everyone,lx",
          "afternoon all, i can't seem to be at all positive today. i don't know whether it's the wind and rain lashing at the windowpanes or the fact of still being ill after 200 plus days,did my usual stroll this morning after the rigmarole of steaming, nasal rinse etc. a mile in 17 minutes. i'm trying to keep any exertion to under 20 minutes.one thing i do know is i'm totally f&@?ed off with constantly hearing the government have ploughed \u00a310 million into long covid. that's a drop in the ocean in comparison to their annual expense claims.i've made enquiries with regard to long covid hubs in my area, however third world yorkshire seems to be lagging behind. my gp is unaware of such a phenomenon. doesn't inspire hope in me.right i'm signing off before i explode in anger.",
          "evening jim i fully understand your frustration its peanuts to them and the gp should know about the long covid hub i haven't asked mine mind you it would be difficult to sort out especially when it's just as hard to get any sense out of them i really don't know what to do next got sarah the ent woman due to check on me again soon and she has already sent a letter to my gp which i still haven't heard anything from perhaps it's going to be a christmas present gary",
          "gary,it's like you've said for awhile we're on our own. we've been let down by the nhs, government etc.you would like to think the nhs would be getting to grips with this by now, however my best pals sister got in touch on sunday to tell me their dad had passed away. apparently he went into hospital with a leg ulcer. prior to sending him home they tested him for covid.on friday(a week later) they rang him to let him know he'd tested positive and to self isolate. saturday he called family to tell them he was positive and was struggling to breathe. before the ambulance or family arrived he'd gone.absolutely shameful.",
          "feel the same jim, all the palaver with the steaming, nasal rinses is very wearing plus feeling ill for months - it's hard to stay positive and agree the weather not helping.10 million is a drop in the ocean and gov are going to have to find a lot more funding than that going forward because there will be one hell of a lot of sick people all looking for treatment in the months ahead. i haven't heard back from respiratory consultant who i asked to refer me to post covid hub so looks like i am going to have to brace myself and phone gp but already know will not get any help - just the usual be patient it takes time, gargle, steam blah blah.hoping you feel more positive tomorrow. i think it is hard staying positive in the current climate anyway without having the added burden of being sick for so long. don't be too hard on yourself - think we are entitled to feel really p**** off - we have had no medical care or help and basically the gps haven't got a clue what to do with us. take care,lx",
          "it's a long list of frustrations we have between us all.it makes me really annoyed that there are gps out there like jim's that are just not with it. the virus has been around long enough, they should be going out of their way to keep up with latest treatments and gathering all the info they can.we certainly seem to know more than them.when i spoke to my gp yesterday he tried to tell me the backache was muscular and nothing to do with covid, i told him it is definitely connected to covid, even if it's muscular, as i suffered these exact symptoms for months, never had before covid and didn't do any exercise to bring it on again! struggled today with the backache and tight chest but feel a bit more positive in myself. i've been busy with some art projects and it's actually helping me to a better mood.",
          "i know what you mean jim it's just not right and the thing is most of the surgeries are quiet because of the covid so the doctors aren't exactly rushed off their feet just like dane said they just don't know what to do or they haven't got the answers not had them since the start five times i went to the hospital gp gave me optimise when i had blood on my pillow then i changed doctors and they gave me olive oil for the wax when i had migraines and earaches sorry the gp said not migraines but head tension that's why i feel no medication can treat covid unless you're donald trump like we have been i suppose just got to get on with it maybe they can give us some dexamethasone or remdesivir which they say can treat covid good luck asking for that though gary",
          "gary,funnily enough, i asked for steroids to be prescribed to me by my gp. for the next few minutes the subject was skirted round like torvil and dean.however, i'm singled minded when the mood takes me.once i'd got back on point i was told they wouldn't do anything. i said they had been prescribed as an anti inflammatory and i was still suffering with inflammation 7 months later. the reply was no.guess what. monday i'll be asking again.in my eyes they can't do me any more harm than the virus.",
          "that's what i don't understand if they can help us why should we not be able to get them so far i have not been given anything that can help i feel if there is something that we can have that may help we should be given that choice whether or not to take it maybe we will have to try and get it ourselves gary",
          "hi jim, i've just read your post about steroids . i think the drops are helping my congestion. it was my gp that suggested them for a change she was the one concerned about my ongoing symptoms. defo insist the drops are betnesol. she said if they don't work she'll prescribe stronger tablets. i know like you that steroids are used for inflammation, which is probably causing our symptoms. they should be trying everyone they can to try get us better now !!",

          "oh dane, i'm sure you'll all be okay.after you mentioned the trampoline episode, i recalled legoland expose on the news. it was as if the past 9 months had never occurred.my only worry is the government didn't get a grip of test and trace and enforcement of isolation.everything i've leaves me to believe they've left it in the vain hope if a vaccine.they'll be waiting a long time for one that's the panacea to all this.",
          "morning dane do you get the stabbing pain in your back i do now and again also i used to get the head tension my gp called it as well as the ear tension i have found that since my head and ears tension has eased so has my tight chest it is taking a long time but it is easing same as the fatigue gary",
          "hey gary, posted back hours ago but i see it hasn't appeared for some reason...yes i do get the stabbing pain but sometimes it's constant and gets worse with movement. i wonder if my headaches are also tension, they are usually in the left side of my head, never had them pre covid.its like lulu said, the symptoms come and go, one day it can be headache, next day it can be backache and breathlessness and some days i can feel ok.hope you're having a good day gary.",

          "hi gary & everyoneyep am glad we have gone into lockdown it needed to happen but obviously feel very sorry for people whose businesses are going to suffer and any hardship people will feel. agree about the schools dane, it is such a tough one because the front line workers need the schools open and children need to go to school but it does make everyone else around them vulnerable. they keep saying children are not vulnerable but that doesn't mean they don't catch it and spread it. glad your back has eased dane and you sound like you are doing ok gary. i feel ok, have got an underlying sore throat and roof of mouth but am coughing less and chest feels a bit clearer but still notice if i do a hard walk my lungs are nowhere near right - if i exert myself it seems like my lungs produce mucus presumably to protect them.anyway am feeling better than i was so am ever hopeful this is the tail end. annoyingly both my hospital appointments, ent and respiratory were beginning of dec so probably be back to telephone consultations.enjoy rest of day and let's hope it will be a good week for everyone.lx",
          "hi gary,funnily enough you mentioning your stomach. during the third and fourth weeks i had runs, noise and a burning sensation.i asked for antacid tablets and my gp prescribed lanzrapole. originally 30mg then she reduced it to 15mgs.i tried to stop taking the reduced level to zero but after a couple of days the acid reflux really started to grate on me. i did read coming off the medication you would see an increase in symptoms prior to it settling.i've had to start taking them a couple of days ago, which immediately sorted it.",
          "hi lulu,glad to hear you are okay.i've received my appointment to see the consultant whom i saw privately but now under the nhs. the 19th of november.it was supposed to be a long appointment to do various spirometry and lung function tests. unfortunately, it's now a telephone call, which like you've mooted will be down to the resurgence of covid.hooe everyone has a good week.",
          "hi lulu yes i'm doing ok thanks but still like everyone can't shake off all the symptoms as i'm typing this my back is stabbing me but i've sort of got immune to it and just getting on with it hoping like everyone else it's just going to get better and do one i thought my sore throat was back but just over talking i think it's ok and i really have noticed the tight chest has eased still there but easing gary",
          "looks like i will have to try something to sort out the reflux jim a few pints of lager might suffice \ud83d\ude02 will try and get on with it gary",
          "that's annoying jim, just when after all this time we are able to see consultants in person - it has been so hard to get any proper medical care - i do sympathise with people suffering conditions other than covid. which need treatment.interesting you mention the lansoprazole jim - i keep stopping and starting it which i think it is ok to do (take it when you need to) but it does seem to help with my sore throat which is from silent reflux apparently. did you have reflux problems before? it just seems strange so many people treated for reflux after covid but i do remember doc saying something about covid making changes to stomach lining so it seems reflux is a lingering symptom of covid. i had no symptoms before this.lx",
          "i'm on the red pal.i don't think it helps until i hit the second bottle.",

          "do you take it every day still? my throat/mouth is bad again tonight, didn't take it this morning as trying to cut it out but everything feels inflamed - just taken flarin but maybe i need to carry on with the lansoprazole - am never sure if it makes much difference.lx",
          "hi lulu yes i do as i take a tablet at mo which can upset your stomach, i do feel better on it tho i'm sure alot of our breathing issues were from the gut later on and the mucas in our throut and cough.",
          "hi jim your not paranoid we've been through the mill with covid i've never felt so ill physically and mentally in my life, so we will be more vigilant. i'm trying not to be ott but still being aware and keeping my distance, mind u yesterday i was tired and forgot to wear a mask in the newsagents had to put my coat up over my mouth.",
          "bless you.i always felt bulletproof until this came along. over the years i've had what dome would say were/are dangerous jobs but i never batted an eye. i don't know if i'll ever regain that feeling/presence but i'd settle for shrugging off the fatigue.take care and i hope everyone has a good week.",
          "afternoon all i've got some good news at last every day now my tight chest is getting better still a little tight in the morning but im finding everyday it is easing and same thing with the fatigue and tension i have still got ear tension and the occasional headache but nowhere near a few weeks ago i hope everyone else is getting better gary",
          "brilliant news gary.",
          "that's great news gary, sounds like you're well on the way!i'm thinking about doing the same as you and giving up all the supplements apart from my multivit and omezaprazole, which i'm trying to cutting down on. i've stopped a few and my nose seems clearer, but i have added a new one too. so confusing, i'm sure they're all reacting with each other, maybe i'd be better off without them. to our continued recovery :)",
          "hi joanne yes i feel like when the tight chest goes i'm pretty sure that the tension will as well that's what i am hoping for yes i'm pretty convinced that nothing worked against covid and it is just a time thing for all of us now just taking zinc now gary",
          "yes i know i am jim it's just time taking so long but it's all bearable hope your improving every day now gary",
          "so annoying, why do they moderate the posts?? normally only if you put a link or mention a product or swear (!) but i did none of that!anyway, amazing news gary really pleased for you. am feeling better too, back on the lansoprazole morning and night think it has helped as think the mucus might have been from nose/throat going onto chest. nose also seems clearer jo. still a way to go but let's really hope there are no more setbacks.keep us posted gary and hope jim the fatigue is easing and you are doing ok.lx",

          "ah pleased you are ok susan that is really good news - i'm same not good at taking it easy but sounds like we are coping and things will hopefully continue to improve on the fatigue front. we must look after ourselves though as far as possible!! i am pleased we are going into lock down makes me feel a bit safer as the rising figures were making me feel anxious when i was out and about - i felt ok when figures were low but not the last few weeks. hopefully if everyone follows guidelines it will help get things back under control. have you had a test yet at work?take care,lx",

          "hi jim and everyonehow are you doing? i just read this article below in relation to recovering from respiratory tract infections and thought it was interesting about the mucus clearance which i know jim, me and a few of us have really struggled with and the fact it mentions it is such a slow progress - think we could have told them that but good to see that confirmed. article went on to take it takes longer to clear with age.glad you have survived the week gary and can get some rest this weekend and definitely good news about re-infection but let's all hope that doesn't happen to any of us!hope everyone doing well.enjoy weekend.lx*****************************************************************************************\"why so long to recover? first, respiratory infections cause your body to produce a lot of mucus as a line of defense against the problematic germs \u2014 and your lungs don't do a very effective job getting all that stuff out after the infection.\"for recovery, mucus clearance from the respiratory tract and deep inside the lung is important, otherwise it will impair gas exchange,\" says harihan regunath, m.d., a pulmonary disease specialist with university of missouri health care. \"basically you have to cough it up and spit it up or else it has to dissolve by the white blood cells engulfing it and digesting it and clearing it. it\u2019s a very slow process.\"",

          "hi lulu same as you really i know that i am feeling much better than say a couple of months ago but not over the line so to speak because i know that the symptoms are still hanging about this week i have been a lot busier than usual really felt tired yesterday but today i have relaxed but i seem to feel the symptoms when i do little stabbing pain in the back heavy hands and legs and tension come and goes but bearable if that makes sense gary",
          "hi lulu and everyone,thank you for the information, it's appreciated.my problem now is the fatigue, which is stopping me from doing anything i used to do pre-covid.i haven't the energy to ride my motorbikes or go to the gym.work have been good so far. i'm supposedly doing four hours per shift but they're not really giving me anywhere near enough to fill 50% of it. god knows what will happen when they want me back in. i'll cross that bridge when i come to it.fingers crossed the fatigue does one as gary would say. it's been a very long year so far.hope everyone's improvingjim.",
          "the fatigue will slowly improve jim it is so gradual its hard to notice. is the mucus and chest/breathing better now? try not to worry about work just take a day at time and its good they've been understanding. you will get energy back in time.lx",
          "it's good news gary and same for me overall much better than couple of months back so no reason we won't continue to improve. i ache a lot in back and shoulders i consciously have to tell myself to relax and can feel a difference when i do. i even tell myself to relax my face! think this has caused us more stress in our bodies than we realise.have a good week.lx",
          "i've only got four nights this week i've been lucky enough to work out a schedule lulu with my annual leave i had a few days to use and i still have fatigue but i rest up when i can at work with trying to improve each week if i'm working i don't exercise only walk with my daughter home from work and take the dog out i know what jim means about the fatigue like you say it will get easier with time just got to manage it gary",
          "thanks lulu i need reminding every now and again.i've noticed a reduction in mucus, which is now really coming from the nasal area. still doing the steaming for 15 minutes, nasal rinse then steroid inhaler and spray. definitely consider the inhaler and nasal spray have helped.my pf is 600 and above on rising first thing in the morning. the top reading is 660 late afternoon.oh i do have a constant sore throat and hoarse voice. breathing wise i'm sometimes sat watching tv and my breathing goes funny. as if i've forgotten to breath if that makes sense.how is your mucus etc?",
          "sounds pretty much same as me jim, mucus has reduced and think coming from nose/back of throat more now. it seems if i overdo it, like a really long hilly walk, the next day i have more mucus it must be to protect the throat and lungs. i read that when you are walking and breathing heavily you tend to breathe through mouth especially if nose blocked up and this causes the throat to become sore so i am trying not to get too out of breath when walking. am still using the neilmed it really helps, i looked at the inhaler but it is prescription only so will ask ent guy when i see/speak to him in early dec if feel i need it. the lansoprazole seems to be helping with throat so i take it regularly now, think i stopped it too soon last time.i do know what you mean and i sometimes take random deep breaths or a big yawn just to get breathing back on track. overall sounds like you are doing well, stay positive we will heal and get over this, it's just taking a long time!lx",
          "you are a little star young lady.thank you for the positivity.",
          "you've done a great job of pacing and listening to your body - think we are all beginning to recognise the signs of when we've overdone it and resting when we need it.glad it is not too bad a week ahead for you gary and sounds like a good idea to use the holiday to make the night shifts a bit easier for you.lx",
          "we've all done good lulu it's been such a struggle for all of us on here and still is but got to believe sooner or later we will succeed i feel really sorry now for the one's that will still get long covid because there will still not be a lot of help for them it's a vicious circle they do know more about it but how many more people have got that letter flu like symptoms will they still send people home who can breathe i think so will they be lucky enough to find help god i hope so gary",
          "i know i think the same gary i often think about all the people who have recently got sick and are fighting for their lives in hospital and also the ones like us who are just beginning this nightmare and will be sick for months on end and yes they do know more about it but as we all know the gps are generally pretty useless and nowhere to be seen at the moment. i genuinely think there is no real treatment it is just time. i think most people will head for the facebook forum as it has been well publicised but think the little team we have here are the best support you can have. take care,lx",
          "totally agree with that lulu you too young lady x",
          "hi everyone, how's everyone feeling ? i'm feeling ok but still feeling the congestion and sometimes tiredness. i'll be contacting my gp nxt week to see if there's anything else i can try/take for the congestion. hope everyone's bearing up in the lockdown.",
          "evening steph i'm feeling a lot better but can't shake off the fatigue getting stabbing pains in back a lot of tension has eased though so that's good still tight chest but easing as well not bothered about medication no more can't remember if i still have a gp gary",
          "hi steph and everyone!glad you are feeling ok. i am same really still have congestion particularly in my right lung and pain on right side and achy back and shoulders. i have probably overdone it, yet again(!!), i worked it out and have walked 23 miles so far this week - mad i know! but i met different friends and ended up doing long hikes and needless to say am knackered now but overall i think the fatigue has improved a lot over last few weeks and feel better generally in myself. i am just so bored with lockdown and hate being stuck inside.reckon my gp is in hiding with yours gary, they are going to have a nasty shock when they have to start the vaccination programme and actually do something. hope everyone else doing well. lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone just finished my four nights off for a week now got really tired monday night but improved the rest of the week i feel like i'm going to get over the line soon but last night i had to go up a steep stair climb and got to the top was out of breath badly and top of my head was telling me your not there yet sunshine so don't push it feeling okay this morning don't know if anyone else has it but i get like ringing noise in my head last couple of weeks comes and goes chest is easing every day now because not hearing from lots of you hopefully your all improving gary",
          "hi gary all sorry been my busy working week, i'm like gary i'm ok but every now and then i feel puffy when rushing around also the fatigue at time and ringing in ears and still get the mucas etc! just keeping at it we're get there in the end. glad the vaccine is going to be soon, we've gone higher risk with our clients at work so starting weekly testing from next week. hope everyone is well.",
          "hi susan good to see your busy and getting through ok how long have you had the ringing in the ears is a strange one i'm slowly getting somewhere how does everyone feel about the vaccine will it effect us or will it just be like the flu jab time will tell i suppose but it would be interesting gary",
          "hi gary and everyoneglad you finished work and have some time off. i have had the ringing in ears since march and sometimes it is worse than others - ent guy told me it is worse with stress but personally think it is part of the illness as had it for so long. felt a bit ropey last couple of days, blocked nose, chesty, pain in shoulders and back but my own fault as i overdid it with the walking and had a really busy/stressful day at work. annoying because every time you think you are nearly there you overdo it and have a set back and realise still far from right. it is just never ending.good to be having the weekly tests susan and sounds like you are doing well although the same as the rest of us with some symptoms still.reckon it is going to be a good while for majority of us to get the vaccine, be surprised if before next autumn, and then it is two shots so the logistics are not going to be easy. just hope they know what they are doing can't say i am filled with confidence but good there is light at the end of the tunnel!enjoy the weekend everyone \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf7alx",
          "hi lulu i agree with you i think the ringing in the ears is something to do with the virus i don't get stressed so think ent is wrong i missed my phone call from mine said she would ring me during the week work has been ok good to have a rest think you have it spot on with the fatigue mine eased last two days did feel the breathlessness when i walked up all them steps bit of a wake up call would like to think it's time it done one and let us get back to some sort of normality i can't say i'm excited about the vaccine either lulu have they got anything right yet no have a good weekend gary",
          "hi lulu, gary and everyone, yes i've got the ears ringing and popping on and off and also the internal shakes which wore off a bit now they're back !! i'd describe mine as congestion normally after a cold or flu but we know it's this little \"sugar\" gary i think that was what you called it earlier on in our illness. i remember someone asking what it meant lol . hoping you all have a fab weekend albeit in lock down.",
          "hi all, i've had ringing in ears since march, think i'll be offered vaccine as a carer i hope it's soon. i keep busy as keeps mind of it all best way it's all a worry.",
          "hi steph yes i did call it little sugar early on called it a lot worse since then though lol \ud83d\ude02 i've only noticed the ringing a couple of weeks ago knew it was something to do with the little sugar i've had about four good days only little tight chest and ringing so hopefully by the time they let us loose we may be nearly there gary",
          "hi susan would be great to hear how it goes when you get the vaccine hopefully soon feel we will probably be nearly normal by then with a bit of luck gary",
          "i will would they give it to us as we have had it?",
          "that is a good question susan i don't know how that works maybe if it is like the flu jab i don't see why not if it reacts with someone who has had it i won't be having it gary",
          "afternoon,just had a good run of days where the fatigue was manageable but i feel totally drained this afternoon.still have the sore throat and hoarseness of voice but i can put up with that.hope everyone's well.jim.",
          "hi lulu,i you think it's self inflicted the fatigue because of all you've done and miles walked and i would usually agree.however, i've had a spell that's been okay but this afternoon the fatigue has kicked in for no apparent reason. i've done nothing that i've not been doing for may be two weeks. bizarre.hope your well.",
          "hi jim at least you have had a few good days like lulu said the fatigue will get better mine has but still getting symptoms ringing in the ears and head now and when i push it headaches and earaches hopefully all will get better with time sooner the better must say don't miss the sore throat gary",
          "hi jim and everyonewas wondering how you were getting on jim. really good news you have had some better days on the fatigue front which does mean you are making progress overall. strange how it just comes back and hits you though when you feel you are progressing well and no obvious reason - maybe it is just a cumulative thing and i also think this really damp weather is not helping us. think may be better for us if it was cold and crisp. i think once the fatigue starts improving you will carry on, even with the set backs, i can see a big difference over last month or so.i definitely walked too far last week and didn't have any rest days so going to try and take it easier this week but did 5 miles today and feeling tight in chest/back. how is your mucus these days? are you still coughing? i find if i don't do much exercise i don't cough other than first thing in the morning but if i do exercise it seems to loosen the mucus and i cough quite a bit. not sure if this is mucus that needs to come up or whether i am just producing more by doing the exercise. i have a respiratory appointment on 9th december (unbelievable 3 months since i saw him) and will have another long list of things to ask - was hoping when i booked appointment back in september i would be fully recovered but sadly it seems not.take care,lx",
          "you're a good man gary.thank you for the positivity.",
          "hi lulu,regarding mucus, i don't really get much anymore except a bit in the back of my throat. i only had a cough at the beginning to be honest , so it's never been a problem.if i could shake the bloody fatigue i could live with the rest, if i had to if you know what i mean.thank you for being there and you're positivity. it really helps.",
          "lovely to hear from you jim, like lulu mentioned i was wondering how you were getting on. like you i'm much better but still not 100%, i've forgotten how long it's been now. i'm speaking to the doctor tomorrow so will let you all know what they say if i think it's useful. feeling positive about the vaccines , never want this again !!",
          "hi steph,glad you're doing so well.from everything i've read regarding the three very promising vaccines none will cause any problems to us even if we have suppressed immune.i just wish they'd attempt to help us.",
          "hi jim i take it the mucus has nearly gone that must be a weight off your mind i never really had a lot of it or a cough give it a few weeks and hopefully the fatigue will be better i've just been out on the bike a few miles it seems ok except for the ear tension and ringing other wise all ok gary",
          "hi gary,glad you're back out on the bike! very inspiring.woke up feeling a bit better this morning than i did yesterday afternoon.yes, the residual mucus is in the back of my throat and married to a sore throat and hoarse voice.fingers crossed the fatigue goes soon. i know it's improved but it's hard to tell.take care pal. jim.",
          "hi allglad everyone's making improvements even though it is so sloooowwww.i've been trying to pace these last few weeks since bereavement, and tiredness seems a bit less, and nose may be getting clearer ( i've got the ringing ears too, almost forget about it unless it gets loud, i've had it so long.i've had a bit of a setback though, these last few days, since i tried to go to funeral last week. i had hr spikes and tingling so i wasn't able to go. really disappointed as i thought that was behind me. i've felt rough since, but gradually improving hopefully.sorry for moan, but at nearly 8 months, i hoped i'd be feeling more able to cope with stressful situations. the strange thing was, i thought i was feeling quite calm at the time. all the best everyone, hope those improvements continue",
          "hi jo,i am so sorry to hear you missed the funeral because of this wretched virus.stress causes symptoms for me as well, which is really disheartening as i've a stressful job. i can't see how i will manage going back to my normal job especially with the fatigue.moan all you want jo. if we can't after 8 months when can you!i've had a good spell but started with a slump on sunday. today's not good either.i hope you feel well soon.jim.",
          "thanks jim, hope you're feeling better soon toojo",
          "hi joanne and jim i have got some good news haven't had the tight chest first thing in the morning for about three days now it's still about but i have had ringing in the ears and head aches like everyone am improving but very slowly hopefully will get a phone call from sarah the ent woman missed it last week said she would be calling back will ask her if others she talks to are recovering etc sorry you missed your funeral joanne can't wait to see the back of 2020 and hopefully we all can push on with our lives gary",
          "evening gary,good news your end pal i'm pleased for you.please update us all when you've spoken to your ent lady if she's got good news on recovery etc.wholeheartedly agree with your sentiments on 2020. it's definitely one to forget.",
          "great news gary, you're on the way to that finishing line :)yes good riddance to 2020, hoping for a better 2021",
          "hi all,thought i'd check in see how everyone is doing. sounds like it's still a bit up and down for some of us.i've been busy as back at work and have opened a new business which is exciting.did the unforgivable and missed an nhs echo appointment because i had written it down on the wrong day! was beside myself after waiting ages for it. thought they'd take me off the waiting list but i called up and they were quite chilled. offered me another appt in a few weeks time...was so relieved. have been having palpitations so would like to know what is going on. been ok otherwise, the odd muscle aches and fatigue still haunting me but i'm pushing on. hope you all continue improving!",
          "hi dane was wondering how you was getting on think fatigue has effected most of us mine was bad but is easing still getting tension ears and head got the ringing last couple of weeks but the tight chest is easing not had it last three mornings i'm still forgetting things now and again probably should write them down as well glad they gave you another appointment gary",
          "afternoon jim and everyone just got off the phone with the sarah the lady from the ent i asked her how she was feeling and how she was coping she laughed a bit told her was feeling a lot better except still getting symptoms went straight to the point and asked if she had any one who was getting there and she said yes there were but very slowly she told me that if there was anything that i was unsure of go to the doctor like a new symptoms told her i have only had the ringing in the ears for a couple of weeks tinnitus she said that lot of others are experiencing it as well i said i wasn't sure what would be coming next and that i was just getting on with it best i could she then said if i experienced something i wasn't sure about to ring her which is good because i don't think i will bother with the gp i told her about the stairs and the breathlessness others are the same she will ring again before christmas hopefully be nearly there by then gary",
          "hi gary,sorry for the late reply my pal.thank you so much for the news from sarah. the news that people are improving however slowly is a boost.yet again you're a positive force among our little cohort.thanks pal.",
          "hi jim no problem at time got some spare at the moment yes so we will get there just some before others i suppose i'm hoping like all of us soon would be nice hope everyone is coping with your symptoms whatever they may be right now gary",
          "hi gary and everyonethanks for this - it is reassuring and interesting about the tinnitus it is obviously another side effect my ent guy tried to pass it off as stress but i know it is not as have had it from the start.sorry to hear you had a set back jo, it must have been so sad and stressful - i definitely feel any stress makes the symptoms worse it is as if body just can't cope with the unexpected. hope things have settled down now.glad you are doing ok dane and congrats on the new business must be good to have something positive to focus on.i am not too bad but still not right!! will i ever be?!!take care everyone and enjoy weekend!lx",
          "gary,where did you find sarah? feel like i might need a sarah in my life \ud83d\ude02lx",
          "hi lulu i had a feeling that the tinnitus was the virus but wasn't sure i'm back to work tonight and sunday day then a week of days so it won't be a problem for me she did mention because it was still new to a lot of doctors they are still learning which surprises me because a lot of people where ill february and march and still ill so surely they know a lot more now she sent a letter to mine two months ago asked if they had rang me said no got a message for the flu jab they must be so busy lol gary",
          "tbf the tinnitus has improved but still there - it doesn't bother me too much and as you say surely they must know more about the virus now but seems to be that there is such a wide array of symptoms.my main concern is my lungs can live with everything else and i know when i exert myself get breathless and can still feel the inflammation in my chest - that can't be right after 8 months!lx",
          "might be time to try and talk to covid doctor or specialist from the hospital i'm not sure if they would talk to me over the phone i've still got the letter with the doctors names on they should know a bit more at least gary",
          "hi lulu i don't know if you remember when i got sent home with the letter from the hospital flu like symptoms possible covid well after that i was getting phone calls from the virtual hospital in hemel one of the doctors then told me that they didn't have a clue about the virus then well a couple of months ago or maybe three i was having trouble with my migraines and earaches told the doctor at my last surgery whom i think got in touch with sarah and she rang me lovely lady she keeps in touch by phone with hundreds of people with symptoms similar to ours just thinking about it was about may or june time i keep forgetting how long we've been ill for gary",
          "afternoon everyone,good news on your new business dane. it's really positive news.lulu its good to hear you're still battling and i'm sure you're lungs will improve.when are you seeing your chest consultant again?i received a call from my chest consultant yesterday. he said they are setting up a post covid hub in sheffield. he's emailed them about me, so hopefully they'll be in touch.from my pf results he doubts i've got asthma, as the variance between higher and lower readings has reduced.hopefully he's having me into his department fir lung function and stress tests.he's said to keep taking the steroid inhaler. went on to say it won't do any harm.i ran out of dymista steroid nasal spray on monday, so went two days without it. i was surprised how quickly the congestion reappeared.i best get back to work.hope everyone is okay and have a good weekend.jim.",
          "wow your consultant is good jim - i emailed mine and asked about a referral to post covid hub and he didn't even reply!! i think that is what we all need to go somewhere where they can link all the individual symptoms and tell us what is happening.i have just started using the sterimar nasal spray together with the neilmed to see if that helps.no-one can say we haven't tried everything!!lx",
          "do remember now gary, so good that you have someone to talk to and ask questions. i can imagine they have so many people who are sick they can't cope with them all.lx",
          "hi lulu,i'd ask your gp for a dymista nasal spray. it's a steroid and decongestant combined. it works for me, as has the steroid inhaler. my consultant has emailed the covid team but i doubt they'll see me. i read a bmj article when they first mooted the creation of these teams. apparently they are for the first 12 weeks of illness. if i hear anything i'll let you know. take care.jim.",
          "i am seeing the ent guy on 1st dec will ask him about the dymista spray jim - the thought of phoning my gp makes me immediately relapse!! yes i think there are going to be lots of loopholes used to stop everyone getting into the covid clinics - as you say for the first 12 weeks of illness and maybe stipulate that you must have tested positive. we will be needing a clinic that deals with people still suffering after the first twelve months yet alone 12 weeks!enjoy the weekend at least we know it will be relaxing these days!lx",
          "i'm feeling a lot better thanks, lulu, getting back to where i was.i think my nose is improving, i'm using neilmed twice a day now and it's really helping, i've just bought another huge box, hopefully i won't need it all.hope your chest/lungs improve, you're doing some really long walks, i wouldn't be able to walk that farenjoy your weekends everyone :)",
          "glad you feel better now jo what an awful time for you on top of everything else. i am using the neilmed a couple of times a day now, have got the hang of it and it makes a real difference. i think it helps my breathing - i didn't use it yesterday as was busy at work and felt pretty rough all day but used it twice today and things feel better! i am cutting the walks down a bit trying to stick to 3 miles a day and not so hilly.hope everyone has a relaxing weekend and feeling ok. lx",
          "thanks for all the wishes on the new business, it's definitely giving something good to focus on. it is tiring though, i slept 12 hours last night just because i could and i really needed to because i've worked really hard last week. symptoms tend to reappear when i tire so need to be careful about that. had really stinging eyes on thursday while driving kids home from school, had to stop on the side of the road for a bit! and felt the reflux last night. so still need to pace.noticing the brain fog...missed appointments, can't recall names easily, forget what i'm doing etc.....took a while for me to realise i had the brain fog, but can't ignore it. keep telling everyone to remind me about everything!question for all of you: do you find yourself more sensitive to the cold nowadays? ok today was freezing \ud83e\udd76 but all i did was walk around the block and my ears were so painful it took me a good half hour to recover!good to hear you're ok jo and sorry you've had a rough time \u2639and glad you're finally getting help jim, you've waited long enough!",
          "hi dane, funny you should mention feeling the cold. you're right pre covid i would wear short sleeved t shirts in winter and was never cold. i thought it was due to the lack of movement.i'll be honest dane if i could shake the fatigue i could live with the rest,good luck with the new business venture.",
          "can't say i ever wore short sleeves in the winter \ud83d\ude00 but maybe there's something in it that we're both dealing differently with the cold post covid.my husband said it wasn't that bad outside...i found it impossible. just ordered some extra warm new winter hats and scarf!i agree fatigue is difficult to deal with, i still have it a bit but not as crushing as used to be. i hope it shifts for you soon!",
          "hi danei notice i find it harder to \"cope\" now get easily stressed by work etc. but that could just be the general anxiety of lockdown and do feel a bit fuzzy in the head but think that is down to my throat and sinus issues and nose being blocked. am definitely a lot more sensitive to temperature - noticed it back in the summer too when it got very hot and humid it affected me badly and now i notice it - even in the evenings when its starts getting dark around 3.30 and the temperature drops i feel my nose and sinus start - it is as if i am hyper allergic to everything these days!i am finding if i do around 3 miles walking a day and about 7/8000 steps in total i am ok - i also need to do the nasal wash and yoga every day - the yoga breathing seems to help - it is all a bit of a palaver though i used to just rush out the door, dash around all day and not think too much about anything! glad the fatigue is easing - mine definitely is too but not sure i could go out for a big night out/party at the moment - luckily one thing we've not got to worry about at the moment, every cloud and all that ... \ud83d\ude02take care,lx",
          "i'm feeling the cold too, dane. i think because my symptoms are like a head cold, i'm more sensitive to it. yes, i'm wearing the woolly hats and scarves too!i've also got brain fog, especially when i'm tired. it seems to hit me later in the day, especially if i've been busy. no nights out for me either, lulu!all the best with your new business, danetake care everyone :)",
          "parties...what are those again? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude01yes i also feel stressed easily so try to get in lots of tea breaks into my day. 8000 steps is amazing, i doubt i get close to that. thanks jo.i guess that makes sense that the cold would worsen your symptoms then if you already dealing with head cold symptoms. gosh...take nothing for granted anymore!",
          "morning dane and everyone i have some good news and some bad i'm having a lot of problems with memory don't know if i'm losing the plot or its something to do with my head ringing all the time i've misplaced my new mask and reading glasses which i thought might find them yesterday today i've just got to work and my locker is open which i might have forgotten to lock yesterday never done that before also been making cups of tea and forgetting them etc only little things good news is on the breathing front no tight chest in the morning when i wake still getting it during the day just props up mainly afternoon hoping everyone is improving and no new symptoms gary",
          "morning gary,i take it work went alright other than the forgetfulness?good news on your chest.i'm hopefully on a zoom conference tonight headed by dr spector regarding the vaccines. it's a q&a type session, so i'll update everyone if and when i can get on.take it steady pal.jim.ps doesn't look like i'll be out for a walk today the weathers horrid.",
          "hi jim yes i actually prefer being at work it takes my mind off everything that will be interesting for you jim a zoom conference with dr who \ud83d\ude02 spector yes my breathing is getting better with time i'm hoping to get a nice christmas present all the symptoms to be gone would be nice hope your fatigue is getting better i feel mine is but still can't push it yet gary",
          "hi gary,yes, i do agree. when i've something to do, so long as i'm not in the mid throws of a fatigue attack, i feel better, as you say i'm not thinking about it.the zoom conference is through the covid 19 app where people report their symptoms daily. doctor spector is the one that's really pushed for investigations into the different strands of the disease. he's on youtube. well worth a look.all i would like fir christmas is the fatigue to go. the rest i can live with if i have to.jim.",
          "trust me jim the fatigue will get better soon can't say when it will go but i know mine is improving not 100 percent i do feel it if i push it but thats the same as the other symptoms perhaps we just have to keep pacing our symptoms till they improve if you feel like your pushing it just rest and go again i've been getting tired in the afternoon then fine a couple of hours later i'm usually tired in the morning anyway but i struggle to get out of bed but once out the door feel ok again gary",
          "hi gary & everyonemade me laugh i am the same so don't think you are losing the plot - spent ages looking for my wrist warmer gloves yesterday which i was actually wearing and had pushed up my wrists - then today have actually lost them altogether when out on a walk - seems like they were doomed! also being doing lots of scatty things and generally have a bit of brain fog going on - noticed it at work too. think it is probably just the stress of everything that has gone on and the tinnitus doesn't help.last few days, since friday when i felt rubbish, have been best i've felt since march \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c but pulled a muscle in my back doing yoga this morning, typical just when i was looking forward to a day of feeling well - think its about time we all got a break from this cr&p and were able to feel well again and get on with our lives! i have been taking antihistamines again, forgot that i took these in the summer and seem to be helping with the head cold feeling and blocked nose.good news the breathing is easing gary, i'm scared to say it but my lungs have felt much better this week!lx",
          "hi lulu yes it's been really strange few weeks for me i must have the brain fog but i don't seem to be getting the headaches just like ache on the top of my head there most of the time still getting ear tension but it's not bothering me like it was a couple of months ago same with the tinnitus drives me mad but a mate at work who had tinnitus said i will get used to it and it won't bother me can't wait \ud83d\ude02 we deserve a really good christmas present for it to do one i've been feeling better same as you last few days so not worried about it just want it to do one gary",
          "i'm hopeful gary this time, i definitely feel a lot better in myself and can see that i look like my old self! but let's not jinx it and see how we go. how good would it be if we feel well again by christmas... that would just be amazing \ud83e\udd1elx",
          "absolutely lulu christmas everyone back to normal would be a great present for me you never know could happen would be nice to have my marbles back gary",
          "the brain fog is so weird...i can't recall people's names easily, forgot all sorts of appointments and also i can find myself in the kitchen wanting to do something but without a clue what it is...only to remember a bit later!i'm trying to do mind 'exercises' to help me get a bit more with it...just stuff that challenges memory and recall. no idea if it will help but trying anyway!",
          "hi dane with the brain fog do you get like tension on your head like on the top not a headache just feels like one it doesn't bother me just there good to know we're not losing the plot just everything else gary",
          "hi everyone, ditto with brain fog and getting easily flustered. sorry to hear about your back lulu get well soon. i've given up on all of the meds now just using vicks for congestion. all i want for christmas is that we all get back to full health and all our marbles back lool",
          "hi gary,i sometimes feel pressure on the side of my head but not on top and i don't think that its connected with the brain fog for me. muscles still tense in my back and shoulders when being active (like folding laundry...not sports!)",
          "hi dane yes i had the muscle tension that's all gone now still get ear tension only left one head tension on top and the tinnitus i haven't had the back stabbing for a few days so thats good can't wait for what's coming next \ud83d\ude02 gary",

          "afternoon young man,yes, i've had an echocardiogram when i was under the private consultant.it takes all of 15 minutes and the scan your heart from various angles. during the scan the operator will stop and measure the screen to see if there are any abnormalities in the chambers and arteries.it's definitely worth having. the test cost me \u00a3340 plus another 15 minute telephone call to say it was okay to the cost of \u00a3110.happy days.",

          "evening everyone,i watched the webcast this afternoon hosted by prof tim spector and one of his senior colleagues on the subject of the covid vaccines.having read through the vast majority of the proposed questions there was an underlying theme emanating from a large percentage of guests, which was; if you've long covid would they, the two epidemiologists have the vaccine and which one.there answer was it could cure the illness.any thoughts?",
          "hi jim sorry been busy i'm a bit concerned about that could bit and i don't have a lot of faith in people who doubt things especially the government i would like to know what will happen if i took it before i take it bit like anything really especially when i don't think anything works against covid anyway gary",
          "hi lulu yes good to know if the ticker is ok i have noticed how much the tightness has eased from my chest it doesn't feel like it's coming up to my throat any more and i don't really feel it now unless i over do it the last couple of days i've had a headache on my left temple comes and goes but it's one of the annoying ones i've found my mask but not my glasses so hopefully i've got part of the plot back lol gary",
          "so did the epidemiologists answer which vaccine they would take? not that i think we will get a choice anyway - seems we will get the oxford one as is going to be much easier to distribute and administer due to being able to store in fridge. well let's hope they are right and it does help all the people suffering long covid but i am not convinced.thanks for sharing jim, was there anything else of interest?lx",
          "hi lulu,they were asked in the context of a larger question and didn't answer that.having just read a couple of articles in the mail i doubt the oxford vaccine will be rolled out soon. numerous heavy weight scientists have found anomalies in the results. apparently, astrazenica are doing a further worldwide study.the webcast was an hour long lulu and covered a few areas. it's worth watching. it's on youtube.",
          "no i agree think boris has got everyone revved up to think it is imminent but realistically i would be surprised if we are offered it before next summer/early autumn if we are lucky. i think the gov felt they had to share some good news and be super positive as people are really struggling with all the restrictions - well the ones that are following them are!!i will listen to it jim, thanks for the heads up.lx",
          "hi gary,i'm doing an echocardiogram next week. been waiting a while for this appointment. this is the one i missed already so here's hoping i remember to go to this one!feeling a bit chesty past few days with slight cough, hope nothing is brewing...daughter has a cold so there's stuff going round.well done on finding your mask \ud83d\ude37",
          "morning dane thanks for letting me know yes try and remember to go this time must be a reason for trying to find out if our ticker is ok my head is still ringing while i'm typing this woke up early going to work soon no tight chest first thing which is good so it is definitely easing hopefully someone gets over the line soon let me know how you're echocardiogram goes dane thank you gary",
          "hi dane and everyonehope you are feeling ok dane it must be hard with kids going to school bringing home all the bugs. yes definitely remember the echocardiogram this time!! i am doing loads of stupid things - added 500g of water to a curry last night rather than 50g - needless to say it was very watery - i was following a recipe and read it wrong!have probably had the best overall week since march - still a few symptoms and slight underlying sore throat but a definite improvement. same as you gary, seems that the chest/lungs have improved and have hardly coughed this week which is a first for me - must just be a time thing as we got sick same week. let's hope and pray it continues! my ears still ringing too but sort of got used to that!i was thinking back to when i very first spoke with the respiratory guy in june he said 4/6 months longer to recover so that would take us to december. i am seeing him again on 9th december so will be interesting to see what he has to say and whether they know more about the virus. also seeing ent next week on tues 1 december - will obvs ask about the throat and tinnitus but if anyone anything else to ask either let me know.take care and enjoy the weekend,lx",
          "hi lulu,you sound in great spirits and improving well.i love your curry story. i take it you need alot of corn flour to thicken it up.on previous occasions you have done our little cohort proud with the questions and updates.may i ask you to enquire your consultants thoughts on whether we should be vaccinated and which one if we have the choice.i know we won't have a choice through the nhs, however privately all options will be available.thank you in anticipation.the day you see your ent consultant is the day i've my appointment with my occupational health doctor.hopefully both will go well.jim.",
          "of course jim, hadn't thought of having the vaccine privately but what a good idea if we can choose which one. i will ask them both and see if give the same answer!good we have a few medical appointments coming up between us, gives us a chance to ask some more questions and find out what they have found out over last couple of months.enjoy the weekend, hope the fatigue is easing now.lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone i'm the same as you i feel i have had a good week only ringing in ears and top of my head is tension did have a couple of days of bad headache on my temple but that's gone also my left ear tension has gone from that breathing is getting better im hoping for all gone by christmas will be interesting to find out what the respiratory guy says because i've got a feeling he will know by now gary",
          "really good news gary, think we can all cope with the last few symptoms if slowly improving. i still feel there are a few things bubbling away under the surface - like the sore throat - but a lot better than it was. just make sure we don't overdo it!enjoy your weekend,lx",
          "you too young lady i know i can't wait till i get like two weeks of no bloody symptoms at all have a good weekend gary",
          "afternoon everyone,i thought i would let you know my consultant has written to me and was good to his word. he has contacted the post covid hub on my behalf. apparently, they've suggested a blood test to begin with, so when i go for my lung function tests he'll sort a blood test.here in yorkshire we've a blanket of fog and it's cold and raining.this morning i managed to have a walk without being drenched but looking outside i don't think i'll bother this afternoon.hope everyone has a lovely weekend.jim.",
          "that is really good news jim, hopefully they will look at the bigger picture rather than the individual symptoms and be able to reassure you that everything will be ok.it is same in london very damp and grey - just been for a long walk over the golf course and have to say feel a bit chesty - think this is the worst weather for us at the moment.enjoy rest of weekend.lx",
          "hi all sorry not been on but been busy at work etc, hope your all getting there sounds like you are all improving! i'm ok still getting the odd mucas sound in my chest and fatigue and sinuses but improved alot, i'm leaving my job o. 23rd dec going back into community care privately only have to do to 9-4 each week and get same money with out the shifts and sleep ins and my 1st xmas off in 9yrs \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 hope the vaccine starts soon i'll get it as in care hopefully.",
          "good evening jim that's great that he came through for you i'm pretty sure that the blood tests will be fine i think had four done in the five times i went to the hospital what do you have to do for the lung function test is that like a scan or blowing i think i would like to know how my lungs were after i've done the echocardiogram maybe actually talk to sarah see if she can help gary",
          "hi susan looks like you landed on your feet good news with work and you must be close to the finish line with the symptoms would you let me know how the vaccine goes when you get it thanks in advance gary",
          "hi gary yes i will if i get \ud83d\ude0a",
          "thanks susan think you will have it well before us gary",
          "hi gary,as far as i know the lung function tests are a series of tests measuring accurately the lung capacity, load test, which is where they have you exercising whilst breathing through a machine and other bits.takes a couple of hours but worth it.i'm sure sarah will be able to sort you out.jim.",
          "hi jim i hope so because if i know my ticker and my lungs are functioning correctly i will be a happy chappy well i mean happier than normal \ud83d\ude02 gary",
          "hi susanlovely to hear from you. amazing about the new job - that sounds so much better not doing the sleep-ins and more regular hours, what a great start for the new year and lovely to be off work for christmas.sounds like we all have some lingering symptoms but such good news everyone seems to be slowly improving. definitely let us know when you are getting the vaccine and how you are getting on with new job!take care,lx",
          "hi lulu thanks and i'll def let u know about vaccine and job \u2764\ufe0f",
          "afternoon lulu and everyone i'm still getting better fatigue and breathing wise but guess what the left ear tension and top of the head tension came back and the tinnitus is constant has anyone had the tinnitus and it has gone? got four nights now off the weekend hopefully someone will be over the line before christmas gary",
          "hi gary and everyoneglad you are doing well. i have had the tinnitus constantly sometimes worse than others but notice it more in the evenings and in bed when it is quiet. i am seeing ent guy tomorrow i will ask him again about it but last time he tried to fob it off as anxiety but i will push harder to try and find out what else could be causing it. when i do the nasal wash every day my ears pop so i would imagine it is mucus or something causing it.felt ok last few days but upper stomach felt a bit sore today when i breathe - have had it before so will ask the respiratory guy next week feels as it is linked to my breathing - think it is the diaphragm area.hope you have a good week, will let you know what he says tomorrow evening - appointment is at 6.00.take care,lx",
          "thanks lulu i appreciate it i know they fob a lot off to anxiety because they still don't know everything about it and it only started about a month ago to me and i certainly wasn't anxious then to be honest i forget about it till the evening or morning when it's quiet seems like we are not out of the woods yet though hope you're stomach improves gary",
          "hi everyone :)hope you are all continuing to improve, it's taking so long, yes would be a lovely christmas present to finally cross that linegood luck with your appt lulu, hope you get some answers. i agree about the tinnitus, i think it's to do with the mucus. i don't understand why sometimes it gets louder though. hope your stomach gets better, i still think it is one of my main symptoms, affecting physical activity, sleep etc. certain foods seem to affect it, like chocolate :( the fatigue seems to be lifting a bit and my nose seems a bit better.enjoy your day everyoneall the best with your new job susan, that's great news!",
          "hi gary and everyonesaw the ent guy. he did an endoscopy and said he could see improvement in throat but still thinks could take until spring to fully heal from the inflammation caused by the acid reflux. he said reflux is made much worse by stress and anxiety. i asked about the vaccine he reckoned we would be lucky to be vaccinated before the summer and no scope to choose to have it privately until all the vulnerable are vaccinated and even then he said he doubted it would be offered privately in foreseeable future due to world demand. he said seen lots of people coming through with tinnitus - still maintains that the main cause is stress and lack of sleep and it will improve. he was very positive still said progress is slow but convinced people will fully recover.so basically all our symptoms are being made worse by stress and anxiety - not sure i believe that but he didn't seem concerned so that was quite reassuring in its own way!hope everyone doing ok.lx",
          "hi lulu,yet again thank you for the comprehensive update. your consultant is probably right ref the vaccine and private inoculation.i met a good pal of mine today who's wife is senior district nurse. he was telling me how they are ready now for any of the vaccines to be delivered or any combination of the three. he finished with all the staff are jacked up for a mid december roll out.i was amazed.hopefully he was embellishing the account from his wife. i trust his word though.fingers crossed all round.",
          "thank you lulu not sure i believe it though only because mine as i said only started about a month ago and at that time i was just getting on with it same as now really and i know lm getting better because my breathing is and my fatigue is and i'm not worried about it got to the point where no one asks me anymore as well hopefully the tinnitus stops if not i can deal with it as well as the tension off to work soon looks like we have to play the waiting game for a few months more then had a really good week as well thanks again lulu got the ticker test on saturday if that's good i'm going to try and get the lung function test that jim was talking about gary",
          "that is good news they are all geared up for the vaccine when it arrives jim - what a huge operation that is going to be - every now and then i still feel like we are all in a bad dream - if someone had told us the whole world would be in this situation this time last year it would have been hard to believe. hopefully there is light at end of tunnel now.hope you are having some good days. apparently there is snow heading our way by end of week so there won't be much walking going on!lx",
          "yep i'm not sure either gary, think it is just another symptom which will come and go for a while. good to have the heart test saturday and will be reassuring. i've had the lung function test so am sure you will be able to get one. as you say we are just going to have to get on with it and get over the line.hope work goes well,take care.lx",
          "hi joglad you are ok. i remember you had quite bad stomach issues all the way along - its strange how we all have some symptoms the same but then we each have our \"own\" specific issues. i've not had stomach issues generally - must be annoying that chocolate affects you - always the things we enjoy!let's hope the tinnitus and all the other lingering symptoms keep improving and we can all just get on with our lives. glad the fatigue and nose seems a bit better - this is the worst time for all respiratory issues with the constant change of temperature and central heating etc. so we just need to get through the winter in one piece and then hopefully we will be home and dry!take care,lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone, thanks for sharing your ent consultants thoughts about why we're all still suffering and that he thinks it's going to take until spring !! he's probably right as i've not noticed any improvement in congestion. my ears are still popping and can feel mucus at the back of my throat. i don't agree it's stress or anxiety as before when we were first going through it. it's just a mystery why our bodies can't fight the last hurdle .....lulu did he mention anything about steroids ?",
          "hi stephsorry you've not had any improvement with the congestion - some days i think my chest is better then the tightness comes back especially if been out in the cold. he did say if i didn't continue to improve he could give me steroid drops i assume like you had but he said he's prefer not to. he also said he could do a more intrusive procedure to see what was going on with the reflux but still thinks as it has improved it will continue to do so.just seen there is a programme on tomorrow 9.00 channel 4 surviving covid - not sure whether to watch it or not!!take care,lx",
          "thanks lulu, yes i really think that if it were still warm we would feel better. defo don't want to take the stronger steroids as too many side effects. yes someone mentioned that programme tomorrow , i think i'll watch it. take care xx",
          "hi all,my daughter had a cold and now i have a cough and struggling with mucus. never used to get this, am wondering if my body is reacting like this because of the effects of the virus.took a covid test just in case on sunday and thankfully it was negative (impressive same day result!)have the echo tomorrow, will let you know how it goes.thanks for reporting back from the consultant lulu...we must be a very patient lot apparently!",
          "thanks for sharing the information from your specialist, lulu, it really helps. that explains why it's taking so long for the last few symptoms to go, if it's the inflammation healing. hope it doesn't take too long, but it seems there's not a lot we can do to help, we just need patience!all the best with tests, gary and dane. glad we are all generally feeling better and hope it continues :)",
          "hi danesorry to hear this, it must be one cold after the other with the kids. we have been lucky and pretty much isolated but am worried as my son is coming to stay for a couple of weeks at christmas - he lives in london and works in london so he will be our weakest link! he will get a test before he arrives but no way he will stay in for two weeks. my partner not happy but what can we do?i find the neilmed nasal rinse the most helpful for mucus, gargling and also a steamy shower. breathing exercises help too - inhale and hold breath four times and on the fifth one cough up hard - pretty sure you've seen this on internet but it does help get it up. been plagued with mucus since march so know how unpleasant it is. good news you had a negative test - all this constant stress cannot be good for us.good luck for tomorrow with the echo test.hope you feel better.lx",
          "did you watch the programme steph - god it was terrifying how sick these poor people were - so if you haven't watched it maybe give it a swerve! i can see now why the doctors classified us as mild/moderate cases even though didn't feel like that for us. what an awful illness.lx",
          "thanks lulu for the tips.have been trying to recall what worked for you guys with the mucus.yes with kids it's tricky, plus i'm working in a primary school so that doesn't help!the echo went fine, thank g-d everything looked ok. still have to hear back from the consultant but suppose that will take ages.i'll keep plodding on.hope you're all ok!",
          "brilliant, glad everything looked ok on the echo that's really reassuring for you - yep onwards and upwards!lx",
          "yes watched the programme lulu, got a bit emotional especially when they were showing film clips of how they were before the illness... also about how ill we were and hearing the doctors say that they'd never seen anything like it as it can effect all parts of the body. all the guys were between 50-60 so i'm guessing it effects us more in that age group.",
          "hi steph & everyoneit was so upsetting i sort of wish i hadn't watched it and yes all four were our sort of age group. i do hope lots of people watched it to understand the seriousness of it and for many it is not mild flu!just spoke to respiratory guy's assistant as needed to check appointment time for weds and also have a sort of bubbling sensation in right side (front) of chest. had it on and off and thought maybe was a bit of mucus trapped but mentioned to her in case she was going to be speaking to him whether it was anything to worry about. anyway she is a right chatterbox (just like me!!) and she told me that nearly all his patients now are post covid from march/april, still having issues but they are all recovering but it is much slower than first thought - i know it doesn't change anything for us but reassuring to know we are def not alone!! she said they all have lingering symptoms which are taking time to clear up.on the off chance has anyone else had a bubbling sensation in chest?! it's not when i breathe necessarily just a sensation which comes and goes and not walked much last couple of days so wondered if it was trapped mucus. just wish we didn't have all these random symptoms to still worry about after all this time!have a good weekend everyone and hope you are doing well.lx",
          "hi lului haven't had bubbling sensation but one of my earlier symptoms has returned, vibrations which seem to be to do with stomach/digestion, and mostly happening at night when i lie down. not sure if anyone else has had them. it could be to do with all the choc, cake and wine, as it was my birthday last week :)i've still got quite a bit of choc to get through, so i'll have to put up with it for a bit.i couldn't bring myself to watch that programme yet, but i would like to at some point. it sounds really upsetting.good news on the echo, dane, such a relief for youhope everyone ok and have a good weekendchristmas tree is going up this wkend :)",
          "afternoon everyone had the echocardiogram this morning said same as dane all seems ok except i have now got high blood pressure so got to ring the gp which i don't like doing but hey ho will do monday morning never watched the programme you saw but looks like we all have a few symptoms to wait to go i know my breathing is getting better so looks like i will have the ringing to keep me company for a while i still get a little tight chest now and again that bit where it comes up to the throat keep getting the weird top of the head feeling coming and going besides that have felt sort of normal this week off till thursday night hope you all have a good weekend gary what's left of it",
          "happy birthday for last week jo! am sure the cake, choc and wine was worth a few vibrations! i had the internal vibrations a lot a few months ago and think others on here did too - just weird how the symptoms go and then come back again, its all very strange. the bubbling has stopped now but no doubt it will be back!enjoy the rest of the weekend.lx",
          "hi garyglad the echo was ok and in some ways also good to know about the hbp - it might be contributing to the headaches/tension you have been having - it's possible. i'm still getting tight chest and odd sensations in back and chest - seeing respiratory guy tues so will let you know what he says.enjoy your days off work.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu yes you could be right i still think the head and ears tension is still the virus but it is easing wish it would take the ringing with it \ud83d\ude02 i'm thinking you will see the breathing improves as soon as the sensations in the back go because my stabbing has gone i just get a little tight when it comes up to the throat but that is getting better i think a couple of weeks it will be gone a little bit of hbp won't bother me sound like a advert now a little bit of wee won't bother me besides that i've had a good week really hoping everyone is improving gary",
          "thanks lulu, yes it was definitely worth it, hasn't stopped me eating chocolate, not sure now if that's caused it, as it doesn't seem as bad, and i'm still eating it. yes, it's weird how symptoms come and go, that's good your bubbling has gone, maybe these symptoms go when we mention them, the same way that they return when we say they're improving. :)good news on echo gary, sorry to hear about bp, are you sure it's not caused by just going to surgery, i know my hr was really raised last time i wenthope everyone ok, enjoy your evenings :)",
          "morning joanne and everyone i'm not sure about the bp to be honest i have never had it before high i mean wasn't worried about going to the hospital they said it would take about 40 minutes only felt like 10 said everything looks fine just before they done the test took my blood pressure said it was a little high don't know why i'm feeling good today only ringing in ears no pressure on head so hopefully that's done one gary",
          "good afternoon lulu and everyone i've got a lung function test just been called apparently its part of the follow up post covid got it saturday afternoon i'm actually looking forward to it that sounds crazy but if my lungs are good and my ticker is ok i can push on from there just the tension and ringing to deal with then and bp didn't ring the doctor do they take your blood pressure when you have lung function anyone know thanks gary",
          "hi gary & everyonegood news re lung function test gary. i had one last time i saw respiratory guy and it was ok - they take your age, height and weight i think and punch that into a device to find the baseline. i will probably have another one when i see him this evening. i think at any medical appointment you can ask if they would take your bp - the things is with bp it is different at different times of days a bit like your heart rate - so really you need to take your bp at the same time daily/weekly or monthly to see if there is a pattern either up or down. we have a bp monitor (amongst all the other medical paraphernalia!) which we bought from lloyds pharmacy but can get on amazon and it has a booklet tells you what is low, normal or high. mine is low which can also be a problem as often feel dizzy.will let you know what the respiratory guy says later this evening - but if i hazard a guess it will be \"it is going to take more time\" not heard that before \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd23take care,lx",
          "thanks lulu i think we all know now it's going to be a time thing for us all i will ask for a bp test when i go for the lung function test if it's still high i will ring the doctor i'm pretty sure it will go back down again i have been feeling good for the last week odd tension on the head and the tinnitus my breathing is getting a lot better gary",
          "that is good to hear gary, think things are improving for most of us now.messed up appointment it is tomorrow night at 6.00 - will update then.the brain fog is real \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude02lx",
          "yes it definitely is lulu i have made lots of mistakes head wise hopefully that improves as well \ud83d\ude02 as the brain fog gary",
          "hi lulu and everyone, aww bless you the brain fog is a real symptom. i'm still battling the congestion. would you be able to ask your guy if he knows the best way to clear it lulu the feeling of mucus at the back of my throat is driving me mad !! hope everyone is ok and improving.",
          "yes i definitely have the brain fog! just tried squirting water up my nose, forgot to add the neilmed, it was agony :( i was trying to work out what was wrong with my sinuses, then i realised what i'd done! and i ordered something and didn't put my full address, so it got sent back. oh dear ....",
          "hi jo and everyonegood to know i'm not alone with the brain fog - as well as getting appointment wrong yesterday i also sent flowers to someone and forgot to say who they were from \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02saw respiratory guy - he was pleased with me and has signed me off \ud83d\ude4c he examined me, listened to my chest etc. and said all sounds good, reckons 90% recovered and the last 10% will sort itself out by the spring - said we are hampered by the weather as we know lungs do not like the cold and damp so will take a bit longer now we are in the winter. also said reckons definitely have some natural immunity but the vaccine will enhance that so definitely have it as soon as we are called. asked about the congestion/mucus in throat steph - he seemed to think it was more related to reflux than the lungs/chest and said to take the lansoprazole daily - i said i was only taking every other day and he said it's a drug you can take daily without any problems and can take long term so maybe see if you can get a prescription and see if it helps you, i know you tried it once before but i have been on and off it for last few months. also asked about my stomach feeling sore and he reckons again it is the acid from the reflux. asked about tightness in chest he said it is nothing to worry about it will gradually improve and get less frequent which it has. i asked if more susceptible to pneumonia/chest infections in future and he said no reason to think that - lungs heal and will be no more vulnerable than anyone else. he reckons there is still some inflammation in body but again will carry on slowly improving. i asked about the post covid hub and he said for me the only benefit would be to meet others who have been through this as have already had scans etc. and don't need physio so he seemed to think a bit pointless. he did say he was seeing patients with lingering symptoms but he is confident they will all clear up and people are all making progress albeit slowly. he did say some people he is seeing are feeling depressed/anxious and may need to speak to gp about that.hope everyone ok and having a good week.take care,lx",
          "aww thanks again lulu you're our \"twinkling star\" in all this madness !! yes i'm building myself up to speak to my gp again so i'll ask if i can have lans , i know when i take gaviscon it seems to help. jim how are you doing ? hope you're doing ok. take care everyone and enjoy weekend when it comes.",
          "thanks again for all info, lulu, it's great news for you being 90% and signed off :)i think the reflux is causing a lot of my problems too. i expect i'll be taking omez for a while, i have a review next month.hope everyone ok and having a good week :)",
          "hi lulu yes agree with steph you came up trumps again i'm same as you i know my breathing is getting better and i know mostly improving with everything else ringing and head tension today i over done it pushed myself on purpose went for a long walk and done loads of cleaning to catch up didn't have the flu jab back to work tonight and tomorrow night i don't mind spring that will give me something to look forward to i'm going to try and have a good christmas would be nice if the tinnitus done one but we've all lived with worse gary",
          "no problem, think we have all had to pull together through this and share all our info and what has worked and what hasn't. i think the reflux has been a big problem for me to get my head around as i didn't have any sign of it before c19 but seems i have now - a nice little reminder!! definitely be nice if the tinnitus did one gary and also the brain fog - made another mess up at work today nothing serious but am noticing i am finding everything harder and feel easily stressed.why no flu jab, was it cancelled or can't get one? yep determined to enjoy christmas and have a few drinks and be merry - feel that we deserve it!! just a bit worried about my youngest rockin' up from london. sounds like we might be going into t3 on 16th so at least won't need to worry about him mixing at pub. lx",
          "hi lulu at work at the moment wet one tonight i know what you mean about the brain fog its not nice keep forgetting silly things all the time never really had a problem with the reflux stomach goes crazy quite a lot flu jab was offered to me but i feel i've never needed it before and i'm used to working outside so not going to bother with it i think your right about tier 3 just got to try and have a good christmas and hopefully a better new year symptoms free would be a great present got the lung function test saturday gary",
          "let us know how lung function test goes tomorrow gary - yep all we want for christmas is ...for covid to do one, once and for all!yep i only had flu jab this year because felt rough still so no point having it if you feel you dont really need it.take carelx",

          "morning sue, gary and everyone,i think the roll out of the vaccine is going rather slowly and will take a long time to reach us. good to hear you are having the vaccine soon sue it is needed in health care.the bane of my life is the fatigue but it is what it is. just have to get on with it.i read an article via the bbc this morning on long covid and the new protocols now in place. shame they didn't have it sorted in time through our venture with covid.hope everyone continues to improve.jim.",
          "hi jim i've had to adjust with the fatigue i thought i had got it right but still forget it is going to be with me for a while yet if i over do it i feel it so i pace myself i changed some sleepers yesterday which is normally tyring and i also done a lot of walking around with my daughter it hit me this morning first thing i'm off today only walk home with my daughter that's to try and recharge my batteries pace yourself daily if you can we've still got some issues to get over the line yet gary",

          "hi everyoneyou're right, jim, even now after so long we still need to pace. i start to get the warning symptoms when i try to do too much, and i suffer the next day or so if i carry on.i've got sore sinuses too, susan, i think it only started with the cooler weather, i don't remember having it in the summer.gary you're doing so well, what's your secret? i wouldn't survive doing a physical job.yes, we'll have to wait a while for the vaccine, hope not too long.well nephew back from uni just tested positive, we were planning a very quiet christmas anyway.all the best everyone",
          "hi joanne,totally agree with you. gary's doing do well.sorry to hear your nephew is positive.when all the school children and students started going back i said how ridiculous it was. they may be asymptomatic however they'll pass it on to others especially older members of their families who won't be so lucky.also who in their right mind thought it would be a good idea to have millions of students travelling the length and breadth of the country to end up in multi occupancy halls of residence.a recipe for disaster.hey ho and we vote these clowns in.god help us.jim.",
          "hi joanne i wish i did have a secret to reveal lol but i have been lucky pacing myself but still feeling like it's going to bite my butt i'm still feeling the tight chest but it's easing the things i'm still getting is the tinnitus and a sort of top of the head ache that comes and goes it's the tinnitus thats driving me nuts lol hopefully your nephew will just have mild symptoms hope you have a good christmas gary",

          "think you are right you don't notice it as bad when you are busy. i notice tinnitus at night mostly and first thing in morning when i wake up. just can't imagine how many people are going to suffer long covid after so many people have become infected. feel sorry for all those just starting this journey.yep 2021 doesn't have a lot to live up to does it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02take care,lx",

          "hi everyoneoh dear, tier 4, that's not good, sounds like we'll all be on tier 4/lockdown after christmas. just seems never ending, hope we see the back of it soon. i agree steph, have to concentrate on the eating and drinking this year!nephew seems to have mild symptoms, luckily, just hoping he doesn't give it to the rest of his family.are you taking antihistamines lulu? i've bought some, wondering if they'll stop my nose from blockingwell have a good christmas everyone! here's to a better 2021 :)",
          "joanne,ring your gp and ask for dymista nasal spray. it is steroid based and really helps with my congestion.jim.",

          "thanks jim, strange how it comes and goes though, today it's not too bad",
          "oops didn't think it had posted",
          "i know exactly what you mean.every morning i steam with salt water for 15 minutes and then neilmed saline nasal rinse.once i'm sure all the water is out of my nose i use the dymista spray. that keeps my nose clear till mid evening and then i use sterimar followed by dymista.oh i know this sounds crazy but i sleep with the bedroom window and en suite window open, which prevents any blockage.",
          "hi everyonejust wanted to wish everyone a relaxing and peaceful christmas - what a year this has been! amazing that a group of strangers could offer so much support to one another in the toughest of times - definitely restored my faith in the human race. feel like know everyone really well after all this time!! sending positive thoughts for continued recovery in the next few months and looking forward to better and brighter days ahead. hopefully, as gary would say, c19 will do one .. once and for all \ud83d\ude02lulu xxx",

          "hi lulu and everyone like steph says echo your thoughts exactly spent christmas day with the kids had great time still got the head ringing and the tight chest it just comes in the morning and evening not bothered about it now sort of hoping it will do one soon \ud83d\ude02 must admit this new variant has thrown a right spanner into the mix glad it turned up now though because its going to be world wide soon the vaccine is going very slowly just seen the oxford one is nearly ready to go like jim i think that will be the one for me i really hope everyone is getting better you've all had a good christmas too waiting for someone to tell me they are symptoms free that would be brilliant gary",
          "hi gary and everyonereally happy you had a good christmas, we managed to as well, different from normal but still nice. i've felt a bit chesty, underlying sore throat and quite tired but overall not too bad. it seems to be rife around here, we all went for tests on wednesday eve there is a walk-in test centre nearby - first test i've ever had and was nervous it would come back positive, even after all this time thought there could be some covid cells lurking up my nose!!, but we all got negative! heard of a few people having had their first vaccines, mums and dads of friends, so they are definitely cracking on and the oxford one will make it much faster. shame for us we couldn't have avoided catching it last spring but wasn't to be. i am the only one of my friends caught it in the first wave but many have it now or know someone close who has it.anyway, fingers crossed there will be some normality in the new year. enjoy the rest of the holiday.lx",
          "hi lulu good to see your cracking on with it symptoms still lurking i went out for a walk bumped into two of my friends who i haven't seen since march didn't even know i had been ill not been out themselves too frightened ongoing issues i'm going to try a few miles a day to try and see if i can rid the tight chest and fatigue before i go back to work if i feel the fatigue will rest up if i wasn't already nuts the tinnitus is driving me there \ud83d\ude02 you enjoy the rest of your holidays too young lady gary x",
          "hi everyone :)it's been a strange quieter christmas, but enjoyable with daughter and my brother. had to make do with facetime this year, but was goodi agree with you all about this group, don't know what i'd have done without it, it's been wonderfulhope you all enjoy rest of the holiday, and as we keep saying hope it does one soon for us all!happy new year everyone :)",
          "hi joanne glad you made the best of your christmas yep its certainly strange was thinking its got to be time for someone to get over the line soon wondering how stuart and maciek were getting on i feel like it's going to be a few months more for me the tinnitus is intense still feel the tight chest now and again and top of the head when i do too much but i feel a lot better than a few months ago so flu like symptoms might be doing one \ud83d\ude02 let's hope it is a happy new year gary",
          "hi joglad you had a good christmas, think we've all had to make the best of a bad situation this year! at least we had some family time and were able to facetime with those not able to be with us.sorry missed where you asked me about the antihistamines - i have tried them when i have the head cold feeling and think they do help but that seems to have eased off lately so not taking them now. i am back on the lansoprazole daily, i'd cut down to every other day, but have had an underlying sore throat all week which i think is from the acid. l have also stopped the neilmed for the last few days so not sure if that is why throat is sore but doesn't seem to have made the mucus any worse which is also why i was using it so will try to manage without - was a bit of a performance every morning. overall not feeling too bad, still feel pretty tired but not sure whether that is just the lockdown vibe and/or lazing around over christmas!hope everyone doing ok and still making progress, sometimes so hard to see as so slow and still seems to be two steps forward, one back.happy new year to you all am really hoping to get back swimming by the spring, that is my ny's resolution!lx",
          "hi luluthanks, i feel like i'm juggling medication and stuff too. i wondered if histamine was affecting me as my nose sometimes blocks and gets sore after eating (things that i like, of course, like chocolate!) so i've tried half an antihistamine a couple of times, and it does clear it,(until i eat something else!)i'm trying to cut down on omez, will see how it goes.i wonder if neilmed is making my nose sore?it's certainly trial and error, and lots of guessing too.be glad to see the back of it soon hopefully, so we can get our lives back to normal.all the best everyone :)",
          "hi everyone, hope you're all doing well and are nearing the finishing post !! i'm doing ok but have got the breathing through cotton wool thing again. not sure if it's the cold weather effecting me. i'm going to try do as little as possible and hopefully it will ease. as i'm posting today i also wanted to wish you all a happy new year . i hope we all have a much better one as we soooo deserve it. xxx",
          "hi steph just to say happy new year to everyone but now i have a bit of a problem because i have come back from the kids at christmas and i live in shared accommodation well i got a message from my landlord that one of the residents is isolating never mentioned if he was because he had come in contact with someone who is infected or not so i asked another resident who said he was confirmed positive on christmas day sugar so here lies my problem i've got dehydration come back which maybe is part and parcel of it or i have been reinfected it would worry me only if i start to feel as bad as i did in march god i hope not the next couple of days i should know can't wait to see the back of 2020 gary",
          "hi gary and everyone,just want to wish everyone a happy and healthy 2021. thank you all for your support with every up and down of this crazy journey.i hope you're all ok. i'm still....well, up and down! fatigue on exertion but just trying my best.sorry to hear someone has tested positive in your shared accommodation, that doesn't help the anxiety, but hopefully you have enough protection from having had it already. no one knows i guess how it works but imagine more likely to be ok than someone whose never had it.in any case keep safe gary and everyone.",
          "hi gary and everyonehappy new year!! 2021 hasn't got much to live up to has it \ud83d\ude02try not to worry gary, reckon you should be ok - if you are worried why don't you go for a test put your mind at rest? it is probably a coincidence that the dehydration has come back. i have felt really chesty and breathless today but as steph says think it is down to the weather - went for a walk and it was freezing made me really cough. i posted a couple of photos on ig and my son in ny immediately commented that no one, including me, had masks on, we were outside in a london park, but he then sent article saying droplets can travel as far as 18ft even from speaking, so think i am going to mask up unless i am walking in the forest on my own!!never been so glad to see the back of a year, actually feel quite emotional it has been sh*te in so many ways and never expected to still have symptoms after all this time.take care, and every day is a step closer to the vaccine and the spring!let us know how you are feeling gary.lx",
          "i used the s*** word, slapped wrist am being moderated \ud83d\ude44!happy new year everyone!am sure you will be fine gary but get tested if worried but hopefully just a coincidence. i think most of the the symptoms still come and go for me.take care everyone and let us know how you feel gary.lx",

          "hi jim yes your probably right just another symptom from the first infection i'm feeling fine just got to drink the water now its weird because the tight chest has all but gone and i was just starting to up the walking at five miles a day how you feeling now jim do you feel a lot better tinnitus is driving me nuts \ud83e\udd2a besides that all good lets hope its all over soon happy new year jim they are changing my work for me now making it easier got to go to site do work and go home lot safer i suppose with the new variant sky rocketing they are being careful gary",
          "sounds as though your employer is being on the level with you, which is good.five miles a day walking is really good. i'm impressed.i've improved as you predicted. i still get intermittent nasal blockage, a lump in my throat and a bit of mucus in the throat but all much better.the fatigue has improved too, which is a godsend but i'm way off being normal.improvement is the key to all this sh*te.jim.",
          "it's good news that you're improving jim we all know now that it is a long process i know that the vaccine is being given out got a friend careworker like susan who has had the first shot got a email from the gp surgery that they have started vaccinations on the elderly and i would get a message when it's my turn think will be a while yet so looks like just got to get ourselves over the line before it comes i will get back to the walking next week and crack on keep going jim we will get there wish the bloody head would stop ringing though gary",
          "morning gary,how are you feeling pal?regarding the vaccine it looks like we are miles behind in inoculating the population when you look at israel.i can't understand why they don't have another full lock down and distribute the vaccine to all surgeries. then gp's armed with a couple of nurses could tour every street and inoculate families in total on their door step. i might be simplifying it all too much but when we're in a position we are, the simple answer is usually the best.",
          "morning jim i really don't think they have a clue if they did and they have the resources to do what they need to do or get the army to get the vaccine out there i like the way they get it delivered on a saturday and say we will be getting it out there on monday must be missing something if its because they don't have the information get it from the gps and liase with them so frustrating still at square one we have to get on with it and wait our turn i suppose i'm fine in myself just the tinnitus i still have the tight chest but i don't feel it so much still tension in my head but not headache just like its there but not giving me a headache weird i'm not sure how long it will stay with me i'm due a phone call from sarah ent soon i will ask her what or if there is anything i can do long process i still laugh when i look at the top of the page covid for 4 weeks and still bed ridden if only they knew just keep pushing on best you can jim let's get over the line gary",
          "yes, i agree with you.throughout this they've struggled to make decisions in a timely manner.the army is a good call. they are disciplined and organised.when i read res35 original post it sends shivers down my spine thinking of all we've been through.we'll get there my hook or crook gary!",
          "we will jim i've got plans for 2024 going back to canada where my mate got married the only thing that i'm pretty sure i would book should be ok by then i hope gary",
          "we'll all be fine well before then gary.i remember the nice gp i ended up with saying it took her 18 months to recover from viral pneumonia and that we could end up having the same trajectory. looks like she might be right.i had the pleasure of travelling to toronto many years ago and would love to go back if the opportunity arose. it's a beautiful country.i promised myself a motorcycle ride across america at the height of our plight and i'm going. it won't be this year but next looks promising.",
          "good on you jim america by motorbike sounds awesome i can't wait to get back to another country anytime soon 18 months to get over pneumonia that is a long time i hope i haven't got this bloody tinnitus that long \ud83d\ude02 enjoy the rest of your day mate whatever you are doing gary",

          "morning joanne yes it's good for me as going back to work today the symptoms are fading slowly except the tinnitus hopefully that will go soon little tight chest now and again otherwise all good roll on the summer with a bit of luck some sort of normality hope you are getting there gary",
          "brilliant, such good news gary, what a relief. glad you are doing well. i'm with you on the tinnitus, it is a constant in my ears , worse at night and morning but think that is because it is quieter and notice it more \ud83d\ude29sounds like you are doing well too jim. how is the mucus are you still doing the steaming and nasal washes? love the sound of the road trip to the us - so good for us all to have positive travel plans even if a while off. hope all ok with you jo, how are you feeling?i am pretty good, bit chesty and mucus in back of throat but have stopped the lansoprazole again as felt tired and achy and wondered if it was a side effect. think feel less tired but hoping the sore throat doesn't start again. i have also stopped the nasal wash . as we all know it is all just trial and error and have to see how things go, have tried stopping lansoprazole before and had to start again but am hoping this time can manage without it!anyway back into national lockdown very depressing but maybe that is the best way forward as so many people not following guidelines, we have to find our way out of this mess whilst waiting for vaccine.take care everyone,lx",
          "hi lulu yes totally agree with you about the tinnitus i had a really busy day yesterday done my work got home and called back again broken rail at bushey so i'm tired already hoping no more surprises in store today felt the chest a bit yesterday but getting better in time so i'll battle on lock down had to be done i still feel back in april they should have shut the country down but they didn't have a clue then and still dilly dallining now this new variant is causing havoc enjoy the rest of your week i'm off to work soon gary",
          "hi all happy new year, sorry not been on but busy, i now doing my new care job alot easier and better money lol still no vaccine tho how r you all! i'm suffering with sinuses more since covid i'm not so tired now tho still get puffy at times but overall feeling more like my old self now. let's hope lockdown and vaccines soon get us out of this pandemic",
          "hi lulu,i'm plodding along. yes, i'm still steaming, rinsing taking carbonistein, lansrapole and the steroid inhaler plus nasal spray.whether they're doing anything remains to be seen. i only have a little throat mucus and my nose blocks when the heating comes on for a bit. quite honestly i should stop them one by one and see if there is any difference.the fatigue is the problem still but it's improved. i'm walking further and doing more bits and pieces.how are you doing without all the pills and potions?jim.",
          "hi sue,i'm so pleased for you. both with your new job and nearly being back to normal.will you keep the group updated on the vaccine please?jim.",
          "hi susan good news about your new job and your getting back to your old self echo jim's words be nice to know when you get the vaccine happy new year gary",
          "hi jimglad you have improved and fatigue is easing. i am feeling ok, still not right but am ok. i still have mucus in back of throat and i can feel it in my right lung especially if been on a long walk. i also notice i ache a lot across my shoulders and back when the mucus is worse. i think the lansoprazole may have been making me tired - i definitely feel better mentally, less tired and brain fog since stopping it and so far throat has not been too sore. definitely worth starting to cut things out if you feel ready, makes life feel a bit more normal not nasal rinsing and taking meds every day and, if things get worse, can always start again. i stopped the mucodyne a few months ago now and can't say it has made any difference. i think it helped when i was at my worst but was fine cutting it out.think now we just have to get through to the spring and believe better times are ahead - this is the worst weather for any respiratory problems so hoping the warmer weather will get us over the line.take care,lx",
          "hi susanhappy new year to you! hope you were able to enjoy christmas.brilliant news about the job and that you are feeling more like your old self. i think we are all getting there slowly but surely. i think we have all pushed ourselves and stayed positive and it is now paying off. keep in touch let us know how you are getting on and be great to know if you hear when you are likely to receive vaccine.lx",
          "will do \u2764\ufe0f",
          "hi lulu,i'm so pleased to hear you are well.how did you stop taking the lansoprazole? did you just stop or take it every other day and then every couple of days etc?i've just done one of your walks. only a couple of miles but the last mile was the equivalent to 13 flights of stairs according to the app. i ended up with a real beau geste on! must have improved.you take care young lady.jim.",
          "hi everyoneglad we're all improving . i agree lulu, better weather is to come, so hopefully we'll improve even more. i'm getting there too. my nose is getting clearer, i'm still using sinus rinse once or twice a day, and it's still helping. my stomach still gets a bit sore, and is stopping me walking too far, but hopefully it'll improve. i've tried to cut down to one omez several times, but i start to get sore chest again, so i'm back on 2. yes, be interesting to hear about your vaccine, susan, hopefully it'll be our turn in a few months. just hoping this is the final lockdown and cases start to drop.",
          "hi jimi did every other day for a couple of weeks and then just cut them out. i had googled lansoprazole and fatigue and it mentions if you are on it for more than a few months can cause low magnesium which in turn can add to fatigue so thought i would see - i definitely think it has made a difference or it could just be coincidence - who knows?!amazing on the walking jim, the flights climbed are so good to increase overall fitness - we live at the top of really steep hill so i don't have much choice if i go down the hill i have to come back up!!take care, lx",
          "hi jolovely to hear from you. sounds like you are doing well although like the rest of us you have a few lingering symptoms. do you think the sore stomach is the reflux - i can't remember if you said you had reflux problems before? i get a sore feeling high in my stomach which consultant said he thought was from the reflux and it seems to come and go.apparently 1 in 30 have covid in our area so just hoping and praying don't come into contact with it again - don't think could go through this again. let's hope that this lockdown does the trick. the figures are just so sad and depressing.lx",
          "hi lulu :)i've had the reflux/inflammation since about june, never had it before. it was in my chest and i couldn't sleep lying down or walk much until i started on the omez. it's been a lot better but i think certain foods make it worse, i had some delicious lemon cake the other day which seems to have made my stomach sore. it's always the things i like!oh dear the cases are still going up, we're very high in west mids. some days i'm wearing my mask as soon as i go out of the house, there's often a lot of people about.all the best everyone, we'll get there soon :)",
          "hi lulu and everyone glad to hear you're all improving . just wanted to say i'm watching a really good programme on bbc 1 the truth about boosting our immune system. half way through it and it's really interesting. thought i'd share.",
          "same here jo, still not fully convinced it is reflux as the only symptom i have is mucus in nose and back of throat and a sore throat but consultant is pretty certain so assume he knows what he is talking about!! - said it is silent reflux so you don't get indigestion/chest pain with it but i do sometimes feel sore at top of stomach under breast bone.shame about the lemon cake - why is it always the things that taste good which affect us badly?!i just feel so achy across my upper back and shoulders, not sure it is from sitting around more or the long walks or some other weird covid symptom but never noticed it before.i am wearing my mask now even if i go for a walk! too scared not to!take care,lx",
          "thanks steph, just watched on catch up - really interesting. definitely worth watching.lx",
          "hi everyone,struggling with tight chest and don't know why. been like this nearly 2 weeks. wondering if it's reflux and if to go back on lanzoprazole...need to be in as top shape as possible, homeschooling four children \ud83d\ude2cspoke to gp to ask what happened with my referral to covid clinic as not heard a word from specialist since september i think... and had been told i'd get physio to help with breathlessness. anyway understand situation is critical in hospitals so wasn't going to push it. but yesterday i received a letter saying my appointment with the specialist in march (!) has been deferred due to the situation and i'll get a new date soon. first thing i've heard about any appointment!well, at least i know they haven't completely forgotten about me....i'm all for mask wearing as soon as i step out the house now.hope things calm down soon. keep well everyone.",
          "hi danelovely to hear from you. i am getting the tight chest too i am thinking it is down to the cold air - was outside 31/2 hours weds and felt really rough weds eve and thurs, felt better today went for an hour walk and it was freezing and chest a bit tight tonight. i stopped lansoprazole a couple of weeks ago and overall, apart from weds/thurs, been pretty good but still not right! no advice for home schooling four children except put more wine in your trolley \ud83d\ude02all these thousands of people getting infected there are going to be a lot of people needing blood tests, chest x-ray, ct scans - seems they haven't dealt with the people who got sick in march so goodness knows how the nhs will cope. let's hope by the time your appointment comes through the weather is warmer and you are feeling back to your old self and won't need to see anyone. agree, need to wear mask everywhere now, even walking in forest there are so many people at the moment! take care, hope chest feels better, i find a hot bath really helps if you have the time!lx",
          "morning lulu and everyone i've been out walking this morning going to do as much exercise as possible or the chest let's me i must admit the fatigue has gone i think i have a tight chest in the evening now not in the morning no more i'm not sure what it is on my head but if i push myself i get tension on the top of my head on the left side also ear as well on the left my heads still ringing hoping someone answers it soon besides that feeling a lot better weather doesn't bother me never has used to working outside got another letter for the flu jab maybe in the next few months get one for the vaccine keep fighting guys and girls we will get there gary",
          "good afternoon gary and everyone,great news your fatigue free, that's brilliant.looks like it is a time thing till we're back to normal.yesterday i had a call from an old friend of mine who i worked with 15 years ago. bless him he regaled a story of woe having been infected last october. both dean and is wife had a really bad bout. he ended up in hospital. says he's improved over the past couple of weeks.i told him of my experience and he was dumbfounded that i was hospitalised. i explained about our group and none of us had been admitted. sounds like back in march, april time the level you had to drop too was much lower.i'm improving gary and the past couple or three days left normal barring the throat mucus. with all the snow we've had getting out has been curtailed but as soon as i'm not working i'm out.your head pains will go gary. i believe that wholeheartedly and without question.oh i've git my appointment for my breath/lung tests, the first week in february. i don't think there's anything wrong with my lungs now but i'll go and see what they have to say. should here from the covid hub after that as i'm having a blood test for them. i think it's a waste of time really now i'm on the mend.hope the snows nit too deep.jim.",
          "lulu,i agree with you regarding the nhs and not having sorted the march group.anyone needing an operation now will be waiting a long time.glad you are ok.jim.",
          "hi jim a we can all relate with your friends good that they got in touch with you i knew you were going to improve i done 4 miles this morning and i feel good tired but good suns shining here i'm a bit concerned about the new variant how the numbers are shooting up i'm hoping they will stable soon and go down again if not going to be a long winter for the nhs keep the spirits up and hopefully someone will get back to normal soon gary",
          "brilliant walk gary.yes, i'm improving and it's been noticeable.there's alot of people in for some real pain seeing the numbers involved with the current wave of infections. i wouldn't wish it on anyone but if someone has to get it then let it be one of these that think it's a myth.have a good saturday night. it's not like it used to be but i've a bottle of southern comfort from christmas to have a fight with.jim.",
          "hi jim what i'm happy about is the breathing it has got better in the morning now i haven't felt it all day a couple of times the normal breathlessness but not tight chest i usually get it about now i agree with you about the head and the people that think it's a myth also enjoy that fight with the bottle of southern comfort i'm sure you will win that one have a good evening gary",
          "hi lulu and everyone, i was also wondering if it's the cold weather making me breathless, either way it's probably not helping! i take a really long hot shower before getting in to bed and find that really soothing and calms me for the night.agree they are going to have their hands full even when things calm down with all the people that will need help with recovery.so many people i know are now infected :(three people on my street just had it. a friends husband is in hospital but thankfully on the mend. a family friends daughter is in hospital and very sick. and a friend who is a doctor and helped me out when i was sick has now caught it. the good news i've read is that the vaccines and prior infection should still help protect against the new variant. not going to stop being really careful but it's a little reassurance in this mess.jim, so good to hear you've improved so much. i hope you feel completely back to your old self soon! and gary you also sound like you're making good progress, great the fatigue is shifting.yes we all need to hang in there..we've been doing it this long (soon it will be a year...!)",
          "hi dane,thank you fir your kind words. i've still a way to go but definitely improving. however, a hangover this morning wasn't at all prudent.i sleep with the windows open so the bedroom is freezing but that helps my nose and i haven't found it causes breathing irritations.glad your okay and managing with four children at home all day.jim.",
          "morning dane looks like it might take a few weeks longer to finally get back to normal fingers crossed not liking the way the new variant is going i'm hoping for the numbers to level off soon and start coming down back to the grind tonight gary",
          "morning gary,yes, we need to keep everything crossed the levels go down soon.i've been watching morning tv before work at 12. there is alot of speculation regarding further lockdown measures because it looks as though the numbers are still increasing.i don't know what it is like in the cities nearby but the village where i live is very quiet.hope work is quick and painless.jim.",
          "morning jim i think they have got it wrong again with the numbers its more infectious than they are saying so it'll take longer than expected to get it back to normal i hope they lock the whole country down before the weekend they keep getting it wrong i'm hoping for the numbers to go down its really busy where i live gary",
          "hi gary,i agree a full national lockdown and stop having all these little nuances where there is so much room for interpretation.being in london i thought it would be busier than elsewhere but quiet in comparison normal times.jim.",
          "hope you're over the hangover \ud83d\ude42i really feel the need to keep my window open at night to help with breathing but don't like to do on regular basis because of security.not sure i am managing with the home schooling....! i hope they go back as soon as is safe... and i hope that's soon!",
          "hi everyone just checking to see how everyone's getting on and happy to see you're all posting less and less. that must mean we're all nearly there. kicking this little sugar to the kerb as gary called it lol. lulu glad you found the programme interesting. jim hoping you're improving day by day like me. my congestion feels better but still the ringing ears. gary are you still having the ear thing ? dane lovely to hear from you and hopefully your breathings better. joanne how are you doing ?",
          "morning steph yes unfortunately little sugar has not done one completely yet my ears are ringing still and the tight chest is hanging around but getting better slowly still have to be careful not over doing anything i get tired but can't complain when i'm still improving just slowly weather doesn't bother me because i work outside lot of rain last night but not cold i do notice around both ears there is tension same as neck occasionally think back in march must have had my mouth wide open lol gary",
          "morning gary, steph, everyone,dud a 3.2 mile walk on tuesday with a steep incline at the end. the app said 22 flights of stairs.that brought on the lump and sore throat, which i've still got but i've just cleared the drive of snow. we've 6 inches here and it's still coming down.shame the council didn't watch the weather forecast. lolwe haven't shaken this s**t off yet but we're still improving.keep smiling.jim.",
          "thank you moderators for altering my swearing but could you spell check the rest next please. lol",
          "i didn't even swear jim just saw a video with hillary the doctors off tv whom said that those who were recovering from the coronavirus will receive basically same immunity as the vaccine so how does that stand with us will it make us stronger or worse gary",
          "i've no idea my pal, none whatsoever and neither have theyfor me i'll have the needle and whatever comes my way does.i'm just glad out of all this palaver i've met such a great group of people.jim.",
          "echo your words there jim but the only thing i'm concerned about is that they still haven't got anything right yet still i suppose there is a first time for everything gary",
          "yes, totally agree with you. it's been an utter shambles from the start.for me i'd go with the astra/zenica vaccine as it's made by a tried and tested method.jim.",
          "hi everyone :)yes, we're getting there steph, i've still got the ringing ears too, don't know what that's all about. all seems to be slowly easing off, sinuses, chest etc, still comes and goesi'm having yet another attempt to cut down to one omez, lulu, having some cider vinegar to see if that helps!hope home schooling going ok, dane, must be hard with 4 different lessons going oni'm waiting for my turn for the jab too gary, jim, hope it's not too longwonder if we're going to get more snow here too, seems a lot up northall the best everyone",
          "i do remember you said that before jim will be a while before we get our turn will they give us a choice though who knows another friend at work caught the virus so we are very light on the ground now with everyone isolating hopefully he recovers soon gary",
          "hi joanne i think you are where i am ringing in ears chest easing breathing getting better not snowing yet either lol must be due some might be a while for the jab though gary",
          "well jo there was 6 inches when i went out to clear the drive and mow there is another 3 or 4 inches to shift.glad we're all improving however slowly.",
          "hi gang hope your all doing ok, i've still not had vaccine at present as can't book one locally spaces all filled at mo lol. i think we're always suffer some syptoms after having covid i still get memory problems it's like my brain goes blank every now and then strange? , also still sinuses and jelly in throut but not so tired maybe as only working a couple days at mo and no shift work could be helping. keep safe all of you\u2764\ufe0f",
          "also i have something to look forward to i'm going to be a nan again in august \ud83e\udd70",
          "morning susan i thought because your a careworker you would be priority for the vaccine we have to wait i think for the gp to get in touch like the flu jab i'm feeling fine except for the tinnitus and breathing not quite better and i still have ear and head problems arise now and again still have to pace myself just hoping like all of us it will eventually do one gary",
          "congratulations susan on being a nan again something special to look forward to in august hopefully we will be back to some sort of normality by then just seen that they have started throwing vaccines away already god one day they might get something go right gary",
          "congratulations sue.fingers crossed we are all back to normal and the world is too.",
          "hi susan & everyone!congratulations susan - such happy positive news for you to look forward to.glad everyone doing ok - i had a bit of a dip last week and have had to start taking the lanso every other day again - i was really coughing and felt chesty but it seems to have helped. i'd love to know if my problems are from the reflux or whether it is still a problem with my right lung. just can't tell because silent reflux makes you produce too much mucus and nasal drip and that then in turn can affect lungs/breathing - just no-one to ask really - the gp would be the normal person to ask but let's be honest we all know it will be a complete waste of a phone call. if things haven't improved by march i will go back and see respiratory guy and see if he can do another ct scan. i still feel like i have inflammation in my windpipe and chest although most of time it is much milder than it was. i also still have tinnitus but can deal with it! the fatigue has gone now which is something but that could be because lazing around not doing much other than the daily walks.anyway, lovely to hear from everyone and well done on the walk jim and snow clearing sounds like you are going great guns. i get exactly same if i overdo it - the sore throat and globus sensation in throat.good news gary about the immunity for those who have had it - the vaccine should just boost immunity further. i'm hoping for the astra/zenica but will be happy with whatever is going!take care everyone,lx",
          "hi lulu,sorry to hear of your dip. i keep having them and stuart mentioned he gad one after seven weeks when he painted one wall for his parents.it's great you have shaken the fatigue, i wish i could. i'm improving but very slowly.i've got a lung function test with the respiratory consultant on the 4th of february, so i'll question him.i am concerned about attending a hospital but i need to know one way or another.definitely with you on the choice of vaccine too.i've reverted back to watching the news again but now regret it. you take care.jim.",
          "thanks jim, yes it's very disappointing but you can normally work out what triggered the relapse. for me i sat outside in the freezing cold with a friend for 31/2 hours weds before last!! it actually scared me as i thought i had a chest infection so won't be doing that again! has been same all along you feel pretty good so then go and push it too hard. it makes me realise that i am still not recovered though because prior to march last year i used to swim outside in the freezing cold with no breathing problems at all.have you heard from stuart? would be nice to know how he and res are getting on. definitely good to have another lung function test, am sure it will be improved since last time. be great if you could ask the respiratory consultant about the mucus - where does it all come from throat or lungs?!some days i can't handle the news as find it too upsetting, was the same last year when it was so bad and we were sick it really added to my anxiety. i felt really anxious last week as didn't feel well but feel like its settled down a bit now.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu,i will asking regarding the mucus and come back to you.yes, i've heard from stuart he was fine for 7 weeks and then had a relapse. sounds as though everyone goes through same thing whatever their symptoms.the lung function tests are different from the spirometry test. these are the ones fir volume and oxygen absorbtion.right time for work.take care,jim.",
          "hi everyone :)sorry you've not been well, lulu, we seem to keep getting these reminders that we're not recovered yeti've had to go back to 2 omez a day, i thought it was getting better but i started to get a sore chest/throat. it seems to be all guesswork, i don't think anyone knows what's going on, or where this mucus is coming fromthat's great news susan, congratulations! it's good to have something positive to look forward tohave a good week everyone",
          "hi jo and everyonethanks am feeling much better again thankfully!! do you think the omez makes a big difference to the chest/throat jo? i started back on the lanso on thursday and have to say the throat and mucus is much better. i just find it hard to understand how reflux has such an impact on throat/chest/mucus and why we developed this after covid - i need to find someone who can explain this to me!!did a long, hilly walk today and feel pretty good a little bit of chest tightness but easing off now. i wonder if every time you have a relapse you improve a bit after? (maybe that is wishful thinking!) my friend reminded me today how far we walked in summer and then had to stop and sit down and the difference now - did 5 miles today and climbed 24 flights - it is good to look back and see how far you have come - it's easy to forget.take care, hope everyone has a good week.lx",
          "hi lului'm really confused about the reflux. i thought it was the acid making my stomach, chest and throat sore, but there seems to be a lot of mucus too. it seems to be improving now i'm back on 2 omez a day, i managed a week this time on just one so maybe that will continue to improve.i've been reading about histamine and trying not too have food that is very high in it, as that seems to cause the same sort of symptoms.yes i wish someone would tell us what is going on! well done on those long hilly walks :)",
          "me too jo, sometimes i feel the mucus is coming from throat and sometimes from lungs but then i don't know if the mucus from throat has gone down into lungs or the mucus from lungs has come up into throat \ud83d\ude02 just be good to know whether still have a lung problem or whether it is the reflux causing the problem - shocking really that there is no-one to ask who would look at this bigger picture. the ent guy just looks at my throat and the respiratory guy just looks at my lungs - seems we need someone to look at all these ongoing symptoms and decide what is going on - not a lot for us all to ask after 10 months is it?! as for the tinnitus given up trying to work out what that is about!hope the 2 omez a day helps - i will do the same try and cut down again when feel a bit more stable.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone,the respiratory consultant i saw said the throat and nasal mucus was highly unlikely to pass to the lungs as the larynx is designed to stop this.i know what you mean about where it comes from though.stuart has been on a diet designed to avoid histamines and acidic foods. he said he noticed a reduction in his breathlessness after eating through it.might be worth a go.he mentioned it being very restrictive and he lost a stone in a matter of a few weeks.jim.",
          "thanks jim that is interesting. what i don't understand is the mucus seems worse after a long, hard walk as if it is produced to protect the lungs - maybe it is both from throat and lungs - no idea but would be really good to know. when i saw respiratory early december he wrote to my gp to say my lungs were clear but he only decided that from listening with a stethoscope so not sure how reliable that is. interesting about the antihistamine diet - ent guy told me you can help control reflux by diet - avoid all citrus fruits, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate etc. i know, from what i've read, reflux can cause breathlessness so i suppose it is worth looking at diet although the no chocolate and alcohol could be a bit of a challenge - not much else left to look forward to in the evenings at moment! had assumed stuart had fully recovered but sounds like it is still impacting his life and i hope he could afford to lose a stone as that is a lot of weight to lose so quickly.i just keep looking back to times/dates i remember when i felt so ill or did something which set me back for days and it does make me realise that still making slow progress.hope you have a nice day, am off for yet another walk!! it is like a mud bath in the forest at moment but it is the only place not rammed with people.lx",
          "hi lulu,i'm no expert in fact it's only what i've read after speaking to stuart. there's a couple of reflux things it can be. stuart suggested mine is lpr because of my symptoms ie hoarse voice, sore/lump in the throat, mucus in the throat. it's worth googling. exercise apparently can bring it on. it's definitely brought it on when i did the bigger walk last week.stuart thought he'd cracked it until the decorating that knocked him over.i'd be going for a walk but the weather here is like end of days. it's horrid.enjoy your walk.jim.",
          "that is what the ent guy diagnosed me with jim lpr (silent reflux) as opposed to gerd which i think is where you actually get indigestion and heart burn. i think with lpr the sore throat, hoarseness, mucus, breathlessness is key to diagnosing it. that is why he prescribed me the lansoprazole to stop the stomach acid coming up and damaging the throat and voice box - just seems weird to me that we have all ended up with similar symptoms and diagnosis - it can't be coincidence so maybe the covid does something to the stomach which results in lpr - who knows?! i reckon we could all qualify as covid specialists after our encounter!hope the weather improves where you are and you can get out.lx",
          "lulu,you're probably right that collectively we know more than them.i've been filling in the zoe app for a few months and every morning filling out the symptoms. all i ever get from them is a sporadic message every now and again to go for a test! you couldn't write it.what dose lansoprazole are you taking?i'm currently on 15mg but i don't think it makes a difference being honest.on checking the weather it is like this for the next couple of days.jim.",
          "hi jim and everyone afternoon here raining and windy i've been trying to work out how to basically live with the symptoms and try to work out how because when i feel really good i go for a long walk only trouble is same as with work if i take it easy i seem to be fine if i push it tiredness sets in and its the same with the walking at the moment my breathing is improving everyday but slowly the tinnitus is constant and left ear and head tension is with me but not bothered about it all i get the mucus but not much i know that they said we would recover don't suppose anyone knows when guess just got to keep pacing for the time being gary",
          "hi gary,i've felt shocking over the past couple of days and have nothing to point to as a cause.god knows when we'll be better gary but please, please let it be soon.i've discussed the mucus with lulu and she has pointed toward lpr, silent reflux and that ticks all the boxes of symptoms excluding the fatigue.pacing apparently the key to the fatigue, so they say.hope you're okay pal.jim.",
          "hi jimi was taking 15mg twice a day, then cut down to 15mg once a day, now 15mg every other day. it seems to help me with the mucus i definitely noticed a difference when i stopped it altogether.take care,lx",
          "thanks lulu.",
          "hi jim i'm fine thanks got to take the kids dog to the vet soon i'm with you pacing it seems to me that's the way forward don't over do it makes me shattered so will pace just hoping for no new symptoms not that it will surprise me if i get another as long as we keep improving maybe one by one we will get there gary",
          "morning gary and everyone,i thought i would check in and see how everyone is going on?i have had a few rough days again but normality has resumed. still have the sporadic nasal congestion, which i now put down to temperature and how dry the air is.i think the silent reflux lpr that stuart and lulu is correct for me. it ticks all the boxes, hoarse voice, sore throat and mucus. of my own volition i have upped my lansopole to 30mg, which i have noticed a difference. i have read that gaviscon advance is superior as it creates a layer on top if the stomach fluid.my gp is calling me on monday, so i'll press her for answers.other than that the fatigue is still with me and the bane of my life. i agree i have improved but crikey it is ten months, so surely i should be able to do more now.whinge over.take care,jim.",
          "afternoon jim i agree with you that after ten months we deserve to be free of it annoying that we are not my bosses are putting in stricter rules we had a contractor come to work with the virus but no symptoms he never announced it till after his shift one of my friends tested positive and is now isolating along with three others so far only minor symptoms one good way to help i find jim is to think how you feel now to how you felt about 3 months ago i know we should be symptom free and the tinnitus is driving me nuts but the breathing is getting better and so is my head like you said it would god i know we deserve to be over the line keep thinking i must have done something bad and it's karma i know the doctor got it wrong with his flu like symptoms keep your chin up jim hope you get a few relief days gary",
          "hi gary,you're right. an improvement however slow is good.some people are stupid, that contractor should be banned from ever working on the railways again. the bloody idiot could have killed people. more to the point if he isn't mentioning it at work he'll be out and about like the old days spreading it to all and sundry. they should lock folk up like him.glad to hear your breathings better and your head,take care pal.jim.",
          "hi jim, gary & everyonei'm with you jim have had a rubbish couple of days again but think you're right it is the drop in temperature. the temperature seems to be up and down and all over the place at the moment - from -2 to +6 overnight its mad. wasn't feeling too bad yesterday did a long walk on the golf course where it was really windy and cold but wrapped up warm and last night had really tight chest and chest pain - it still really scares me and don't know if it my lungs or the reflux but think it is mucus build up. woke up this morning and that had gone so went for another walk and no tight chest but have the head cold feeling - sinuses all bunged up and tingling feels like head about to explode. am so done with all this just can't see an end to it - seriously thinking maybe this is it - just have to live like it and deal with it. i was put on gaviscon advance when i first started the lansoprazole but it made me feel really sick.i think i may have to call my gp but every time i think of doing so i just think what is the point what are they going to do? - its very depressing not having any medical help. i still get the burning sensation when i inhale and have no idea again whether it is related to the reflux or my lungs. am so fed up with feeling unwell - and every day wondering how am going to feel and then symptoms can change during the day for no apparent reason - i am genuinely worn out trying to work it all out! i can see the ent guy again about the reflux and the respiratory guy about lungs but i need someone to link all the symptoms and tell me what is causing which symptoms but the bottom line is i don't think they know. also like to know why we all seem to have lpr now - how did that happen?!that's my whinge over .....!!! will now dust myself off and get on with it! on a positive note the fatigue is definitely better, i feel tired but not that awful fatigue of a few months ago. hope everyone else ok, sorry to moan just feeling a bit low and worn out with it all.lx",

          "thanks jim, i know you guys are the only ones who really understand and that really helps a lot. i think it is the continued disappointment that you feel you are nearly better and it hits again.take care, lx",
          "hi lulu and everyone,sorry to hear you've had a few rubbish days lulu it's such an up and down virus and so are the after effects. no two days are the same. i too have the lpr as the main symptom now. i'm taking 30mg lans every other day to keep it at bay and sometimes it's worse than other times. never had reflux issues before and defo think something's going on with our stomach's. had a tooth out last week and was a bit worried about the injections and side effects combined with this but it's all good. hope everyone has a good week.",
          "thanks steph, am back taking the lansoprazole every day again 15mg in the morning - will see if that helps. i did read that it is hard to stop taking it because the acid increases again quite quickly - ive tried to stop twice and both times ended up taking it again. might end up a lansoprazole junkie! so strange a few of us have this lpr now - i'd never even heard of it pre-covid!glad you are ok after having tooth out - probably last thing you needed on top of everything else!take care,lx",
          "hi everyone :)sorry you've not been well, lulu, it seems we're still having an up and down time, even after 10 months.i'm on omez twice a day, i must have the gerd form of reflux as it affects my stomach.that's good you survived dentist, steph, i'm due to go soon so that sounds hopeful for mei agree jim, we're all entitled to moan after it's gone on for so long.hopefully we're all getting more and more improvements :)",
          "morning jo and everyone,i spoke to my gp yesterday and explained my symptoms and of my own volition i had increase the lansrazpole to 30mg. she agreed with what i had done. i've now a prescription for that level and also pepcid. hopefully that will rid me of the hoarse voice, sore throat and throat mucus. she explained the symptoms are pointing to lpr.she reaffirmed what she said june of last year that she thinks we will recover but 18 months is usual for such a serious infection.well, 12 months will soon be up!take care everyone.jim.",
          "afternoon everyone eighteen months jim don't we get anything for good behavior on a serious note sorry your having to a tough time lulu we've all been through so much together and still are i'm getting tinnitus badly well i don't know if it's bad but it's driving me nuts i know i have to pace myself because i'm feeling a lot tiredness when i do too much that also might be age the breathlessness is getting better slowly keep your spirits up everyone by the summer we will be climbing mountains gary",
          "thanks jim and everyonewell 18 months - we will be chalking the days off soon. remember the days in the summer when we counted the weeks - seems so long ago! i just feel we will improve even more when the weather gets warmer - this has to be the worst weather for any respiratory illness.my voice is still very hoarse - ent guy said the acid/inflammation damages the throat and voicebox and as the lansoprazole stops the acid it slowly heals. again it seems to just be a case of time.i think you are right jo gerd seems to affect stomach and more heartburn and with lpr you don't even know you have it until you get all the sore throat/voicebox/mucus symptoms. i didn't have this when i was first ill so must be the result of the virus. think it started around july/august.the tinnitus is really annoying gary, let's hope it does one soon!have a good week everyone, thanks again for perking me up \ud83d\ude00 think this lockdown seems tougher than the previous ones, hope everyone is coping ok.lx",
          "gary that did make me chuckle!if i was the beak i'd definitely say a suspended was in order or a conditional discharge.gary your a tough cookie you can handle the tinnitus. it'll go pal.fingers crossed it is soon.jim.",
          "you hang in there lulu there are better times ahead.as you and gary keep kindly reminding me, think back to where we we're in the summer.it's slow but we're getting there.jim.",
          "yes i know jim i will grin and bear it and crack on hopefully it will do one soon like you said to lulu we are a lot better than we were it's just dragging enjoy the rest of your evening gary",
          "yes we should all be proud of ourselves and how far we've come without medical intervention and very little help and advice from our gp's. so glad we're at this end of the illness and not just starting !! i remember the days when even changing bedsheets left me exhausted and i remember you doing the lawn jim and it putting you back on your recovery. it's onwards and upwards now for us all. good luck for dentist joanne but you won't need it, you'll be fine. hoping you have a better week lulu.",
          "hi steph yes i agree them nights of sweats and sore throats don't miss them hopefully in a few months the whole lot has done one gary",
          "hi gary, my friend is going through it now. she couldn't speak to me over weekend as she gets too breathless, i remember those days well !! thankfully we're much better now. little sugar has nearly done one !!",
          "yes we do steph hope your friend gets well soon i had a mate at work whom got it as well but he is going to be fine think we must have opened our mouths too much back in march can't wait till little sugar completely free gary",
          "how i remember cutting the lawns. it was the 2nd of may 2020 and it's indelibly etched on my soul. a week in bed on the back of it!we should celebrate getting this far and surviving the bloody thing. 100,000 haven't.onward and upward as they say.you guys are never far from my thoughts. you really helped me through it!i shall be forever grateful.jim.",
          "thanks gary i check in with her regularly and i'm hoping she starts to improve but she's not good atm. you were defo spot on when you named it\" little sugar\" we've had some laughs along the way as well as some very dark times....",
          "yes who've thought mowing the lawn or changing bedding would take us to our beds and wipe us out like that !! yes defo agree jim we've all helped each other and been there for each other when it's been needed, thanks everyone.",
          "yes totally agree with you and jim is right we've all helped each other and doctor google its sad so many people have lost their lives and i feel the chinese government and also our own have got a lot of things very wrong not that they will learn from it i'm hoping that the nhs now knows a lot more than they did and the numbers come down to zero hope you're friend pulls through steph time for bed gary",
          "hi everyoneso sorry to hear about your friend, steph, hope she's ok, she's lucky to have you for support and advice.i agree with you all, we've been so lucky finding this forum and helping each other along the way.yes thinking back to last year, things are a lot better and hopefully improving all the time.enjoy your day everyone :)",
          "hi joanne i agree with you things are a lot better now only left with tinnitus and breathing now glad i never experienced the one they are talking about now parosomia that doesn't smell good warmed up a bit last couple of days here enjoy the rest of your day gary",
          "hi lulu i hope you are feeling better than you were a few days ago i'm slowly getting over the tightness very slowly it probably bothers me more in the evening really tinnitus is still the same and still getting ear tension but feeling a lot better i'm wondering about walking a few miles a day again but the last time i did tiredness set in so was wondering how you felt after walking like the next day it's not like fatigue but last time i done about five miles felt terrible next day i hope everyone is getting better and have a good weekend gary",
          "hi gary & everyonei think i am feeling better than i was - still got a lot of burning mucus in back of throat and of course the tinnitus!! am trying taking the lansoprazole only when i need it - think steph did this for a while so will see if it helps. i think taking it every day was causing other symptoms with stomach - after all this time it is still trial and error.i don't think need to walk more than 3 miles daily to get/keep you fit especially if you can incorporate a couple of hills and increase to a decent pace - i normally go out around lunch time when it is a bit warmer. on the days when it was freezing cold i felt tight chest in the late afternoon/eve but it would wear off by the next day. they say you should wrap a scarf loosely around your mouth so you don't inhale the freezing air as that aggravates the lungs. if the weather ok, like today, i don't get the chest tightness.i don't feel the terrible fatigue any more it is just normal tiredness. also trying to not focus on dreaded covid too much, switched off the news (did this also in the summer) and try not to read any depressing stories i was getting too sucked into the doom and gloom and anxiety and it wasn't doing me any good. it just made me feel so sad.hope everyone doing ok and have good weekends - hope your friend is improving now steph and as jo said she is very lucky to have you for support.take care,lx",
          "hi lulu thanks i will try the 3 miles see how it goes i can always step it up in a few weeks see how it goes weather doesn't bother me so not a problem may be over done it last time have a good weekend young lady gary",
          "afternoon lulu and everyone thought i would just give you all a little boost i've just read an update from paul garner whom a lot of us followed a while ago anyway he has fully recovered and basically we've all been doing everything nearly right just got to forget about the little sugar and get on with it keep exercising and busy and rest when we need it have a read interesting article gary",
          "hi gary,that's fabulous news and thank you for sharing it.i must admit i've been feeling better over the past week.since i've spoken again to my gp and complained about my lump, sore and mucus filled throat she's put me on lansrazole 30mg and pepcid after meals.it has really improved my throat, which helps the general feel of being better.you take care my pal. jim.",
          "that's great news jim i feel now just gotta get on with it which basically i was trying to and it will take care of itself easier said than done but got to be a lot easier than it is was gary",
          "i read this gary, think it caused a bit of controversy as he was implying it was mind over matter and some people took offence to that thinking he was saying you could think yourself better - i think what he was actually saying was that you have to be positive and stop focussing on the illness and just get on with it - he was probably at similar point as us where he was almost there and just changed his mindset a bit. he came off the facebook/twitter forums where he had been very active and cracked on with it. that's where we have been lucky having our little group where the vibe has generally been optimistic, positive and all encouraging one another. i remember being on twitter for a while and following #longcovid - it was so depressing and not helpful for me.good news jim, i agree when my throat is not thick with mucus feel so much better in self. had a great day yesterday, i stayed in all day and felt good and still ok today but been for a cold windy walk so a bit more mucus and chesty - just proves how affected by the cold weather. hope everyone doing ok and had good weekends, onwards and upwards we are nearly there!lx",
          "hi lulu just shows you how people can misinterpret things then so glad i never did twitter just don't know i do feel a lot better lately not had a dip that we used to get just the breathing and tinnitus unless something else pops up enjoy the rest of your weekend gary",
          "hi gary and lulu,on your recommendation i've read the article, which is very encouraging.one of the many strings to covid's bow is to depress and give great anxiety to the sufferer. a pal of mine has mooted similar comments for the past couple of months, which i ignored as hot air from someone without any knowledge of the illness. well, i have to admit a positive out look is a must with this crap.i know we all have our good and bad days and we've all been helped out by our little cohort.i will endeavour to be as positive as possible and do more and stop think constantly about the outcome of everything i do.so as usual if i need a kick up the old trumper please oblige.jim.",
          "a kick up the old trumper not heard that that said before jim we probably all need one of them from time to time i'm normally not one to beat around the bush and try to copy catch phrase and say what i see or believe to be right and that is why i trust everyone on here because we have all helped one another through this horrible illness and hopefully better times ahead for all of us gary",
          "indeed my pal.it might sound strange but i consider our little group friends even though we've never met.i do hope when this is all over we meet for a glass or three.",
          "hi everyone, hope you're all okit sounds like we've been doing the right thing all along, keeping positive and not dwelling on it. i know i feel worse when i think too much about it or read too much. definitely agree with gary's motto all along to get on with it.i feel like i'm going round in circles though at the moment, i usually know what to expect, and it all seems very familiar, high energy days followed by suffering from doing too much, then pick up again, ready to start it all again. the symptoms are getting milder and i know when to take it easy.have a good day :)",
          "that made me laugh \ud83d\ude02 a kick up the old trumper - not heard that expression before but i like it!! lx",
          "bless you lulu.it's a good old fashioned yorkshire saying.i have many, so i've been told.must be an age thing.",
          "hi everyone, just wanted to check in and see how you're all doing. thanks for good wishes for my friend. unfortunately she's still very up and down still nearly 6 weeks in. reminds me of how ill we all were in the early days. i know she'll get there eventually. i'm also feeling a lot better these days. hoping that by april 5th i'll be feeling 100 % as that'll be a whole year !! jim i think it'll be the same or thereabouts for you too. echo your words about maybe meeting up when we're all fully recovered as i know we've all been through the unimaginable and feel like we've dodged a bullet !!",
          "evening steph,your friend will be okay but it might be a while, as we know.my years up on the 1st of april.i remember calling work to say i had a slight temperature and i wouldn't be in.who would have guessed ten months later i haven't been back or seen any of them barring on supervisor calling in september.as soon as we are all okay the first round is on me.jim.",
          "hi jim all, you do make me laugh jim at least you never lost your sense of humour. have any of you suffered really badly with sinuses this winter it's been hell since middle dec and still is, i'll be getting vaccine in next couple weeks now as i left my job and do private care now i'm not eligible for one apparently, but have just been employed again into social care, i start in couple weeks they will send me link to get one sorted, has anyone else had jab yet?. can't wait til spring when we can all get outside again and lighter evenings and on beach again. love to you all \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\u26f1\ufe0f\u26f1\ufe0f",
          "morning sue,my nose closes every evening at 6:30pm? however, to keep it clear i neilmed on getting up after 15 minutes of steaming. i use the dymista spray afterwards.at 6:30pm i sterimar the dymista again, so the old hooter is clean and clear.no one has had a vaccine yet, so you will be our first.please let us know how it goes.big hugs,jim.",
          "hi susanlovely to hear from you, great news about the jab, good luck with it. i've had a lot of trouble with sinuses over the winter, sore and getting blocked. i found neilmed helped, as jim mentioned, and it seems to have improved recently. i'll have to get some of that nose spray if it starts blocking again!it's weird how symptoms come and go, it's the heartburn that's bothering me at the moment, and not sure if the omez is having any effect.yes looking forward to the spring and warmer weather, lucky you with beach, haven't seen the sea for a while :)",
          "hi sue and everyone,i've been for my lung function tests this morning. nothing to report, as they leave it to the consultant to pass on his views.i hope everyone is well and improving.jim.",
          "hi susan & everyone!i've had really bad sinus issues and comes and goes dependent on the temperature - i've been using the neilmed again and olbas oil stick. i just find my symptoms go round in circles - one day blocked sinus, next day sore throat, next day very chesty, next day achy eyes and shoulders - luckily i don't seem to get them all at once and mostly resolve over night and wake up with something different! it is like a lucky dip - i try and work out which is the best/worst symptom! oh and the tinnitus is a consistent always there in the background!jo, am the same always trying to work out whether the lansoprazole helps or not - on a good day i think it does and on a bad day it doesn't!hope the lung function test comes back showing some improvement jim.let us know how the vaccine goes susan and definitely roll on spring and hopefully the sunshine will make things feel better.take care, everyonelx",
          "thanks lulu.they seemed to be happy with what i did but who knows. roll on the 11th.hugs,jim.",
          "hi jo and everyonehope everyone enjoying the weekend - at least these days one guarantee is that it will be relaxing!just wondered if anyone is taking antihistamines? i took them back in summer and remember they helped but have been reading a lot about allergic rhinitis and post nasal drip (exciting life i'm leading!) as trying to work out whether my symptoms are caused by the silent reflux, the rhinitis or a problem with lungs - anyway decided to try them again and see what happens with the blocked nose etc. and was wondering if anyone has tried them recently?lx",
          "hi lului've taken half an antihistamine a couple of times when my nose has blocked after eating. it seemed to help, so i'm trying to cut down on high histamine foods. i've also been taking quercetin for a while (a natural antihistamine, i think)i stopped taking it when i ran out as i didn't think it was doing anything, but when i stopped my chest seemed to be more tight and congested, so i started taking it again.it's all guesswork though really, i keep reading things too, although i try not to. i think we're all so desperate to get better after so long.hope everyone had a good weekend, yes definitely restful these days :)",
          "that's interesting jo, i took an antihistamine last night as the overall feeling in my nose and throat feels like it's a reaction to something - feels all tingly and particularly bad if been out in cold. anyway noticed quite a big difference today and generally felt better - did a long, cold, snowy walk to test it out as normally i would have a tight chest and sore throat after that but it was pretty good. just wonder if it is the allergic rhinitis causing the mucus in nose and throat rather than the silent reflux (am so confused!! think they are actually both linked but different treatments) the lansoprazole did help initially but seems less effective lately so thought i'd trying treating the rhinitis! - be nice if actually had some proper medical support rather than having to work it out ourselves \ud83d\ude44anyway will let you know how it goes later this week, am going to take the antihistamine every evening (apparently best to take at night as takes about 8 hours to kick in) and it is going to be freezing this week so will soon find out if helps!take care,lx",
          "i'm back on 2 omez, i seem to get more heartburn when i cut down, although stomach seems better at the moment (i shouldn't have said that!)i'm becoming more aware of the cycles at the moment, one really high energy day followed by several fairly tired days, then gradually picking up again. i'm trying not to overdo it on the high energy days, and rest more when i'm tired. it's the same as pacing really, as we've been doing, but i'm trying to avoid those really low energy days.all the best :)",
          "sorry lulu, i tried to edit, and lost the first half of my message!!just wanted to say, it sounds hopeful with antihistamines, so may be i'll take them too. jo x",
          "hi joanne and everyone just finished a week of nights a very busy one as well and i'm pleased to say that i'm improving all the time slowly but last night was when i noticed my breathing is getting better because i was tired after a busy week but i still managed to get up some very high steps and get my breath back in a couple of minutes when about a month ago i really struggled i'm only getting the tight chest occasionally most of the other symptoms seem to have gone except the tinnitus and occasional stomach ache so its like we have said time thing with the pacing gary",
          "hi gary and everyoneyou have done so well, a week of nights must be really tough especially when it is freezing cold out and good you can look back and see you are making progress. is there any pattern to the tight chest? are you still getting mucus in nose/throat or is that all ok now? i just feel frustrated that nearly a year on still feel like my throat, nose and lungs don't feel right - my lungs feel tight especially after exercise or in the cold. am pinning all my hopes on spring and the warmer weather but glad you are doing well, you've had a tough, physical job to do and must have been hard when not feeling great. you've definitely had to push yourself.take care,lx",
          "well done gary!i'm pleased for you my pal.",
          "hi lulu yes i still get mucus and i still get the odd back stabbing but i never really had the mucus bad and i've always worked outside so the weather doesn't really bother me was cold last night though and i do get a little sensation in my throat but it's not sore anymore and i had that bad the tight chest turns up in the morning or evening but it's easing slowly and what i have noticed is the headaches have stopped like jim said they would and the ear tension i had for a long time has gone and hopefully staying gone with the tinnitus joining it soon gary",
          "thanks jim roll on the end of it mate we're slowly getting back to normal gary",

          "hi everyone, so happy to read that things are improving for us all. i've cut out milk from my diet only having a dash in tea/coffee and my congestion and mucus has improved a lot also the ringing ears. gary good news hoping soon you'll have nothing to report and will be well rid of this sugar !! jim hoping your test results are good and same for you , will have nothing to report soon fingers crossed. lulu hoping your experiment with antihis works. joanne, susan hope you're both ok.",

          "hi gary and everyone,i've been meaning to pop back on here and check how you're all getting on but don't seem to get a quiet moment!sounds like you're ok but still figuring if there's rhyme or reason to any of the symptoms . i'm wondering the same...still...interesting lulu and jo about the antihistamine. i had a call from long covid physiotherapist asking if i still need help with recovery as they have a big backlog of appointments (yes i do!).i was explaining the breathlessness and tight chest and he told me, unofficially, that he also has long covid but takes an antihistamine (cetirizine) every day and it's helped him.unfortunately all it did for me was make me very tired and i don't feel i can handle that (i didn't feel it helped with breathlessness but that might just be me!)i'm struggling quite a bit with tight chest and difficulty taking a deep breath, some days are quite challenging like that. and still can't figure out what makes it worse or better. as for homeschooling...a lot of emotions flying every day!keep well and warm everyone!",
          "hi dane it will improve the tight chest i know it's annoying and frustrating but mine is a lot better now i still get the tight chest but only in the morning and at night and i walked up a lot of steps the other night and i didn't feel out of breath like i did a few weeks ago and i haven't taken any medication for it time only i'm getting stomach troubles and tinnitus but feeling better all the time you have done great dane especially with the kids to deal with as well gary",
          "hi gary and everyone,just spoken to my respiratory consultant and he says my lungs are tip top, 100% okay.i have now stopped the mucus tablets and inhaler at his request/advice.the post covid hub i had been referred to has stopped, as the funds have been redirected to the frontline.hey ho.we've come this far without, so we might as well finish without.jim.",
          "onwards and upwards jim great news though i don't think that they will have time to help everyone with all their problems because we don't know the scale of what's coming behind us still don't think they know exactly what to do but learning slowly least you can have a good blow now suns shining here and feeling like i'm getting better every day hopefully someone will be 100 percent soon enjoy the rest of your day gary",
          "gary,totally agree. they still have no idea what to do with us.regarding numbers. when i catch the news and they reel off the numbers of new infections i cringe thinking of all those that will go through what we have.the suns shining here too but its parky out.take care,jim.",
          "hi jim that's great news defo peace of mind for you. like you say we've managed without too much medical intervention so far and hopefully we get to the finishing line soon... dane lovely to hear from you but sorry you're still feeling tight chest. mine feels a lot better like gary's and so is the congestion. i just have the internal shakes now but they are improving too. looking forward to march now and the warmer weather fed up of the snow now !!!",
          "thanks steph.definitely good news for a change!we've all got to keep positive and push on like gary says.we'll get there in the end.oh and i'm fed up with being cold and all this snow.roll on summer.take care.jim.",
          "hi dane and everyonelovely to hear from you! not surprised you are pressed for time home schooling 4 kiddies - must be tough especially whilst not feeling 100% - i can only imagine!interesting what the guy said about the antihistamine - it has made a huge difference to me this week - i've taken claritin which is a non-drowsy one and only take half a tablet (think jo recommended this). i started taking a whole tablet but it gave me a dry mouth so cut it down. i take it at night as it is supposed to be the most effective 6/8 hours after taking and have been waking up feeling so much better than i had been. it has helped hugely with the mucus/post nasal drip (really dried it up and hardly coughing) which i think was also making my throat and chest sore - i feel it too dane when i take a deep breath and it has helped that too. i still question the silent reflux diagnosis i had - i feel i have allergies (never had them before!) probably triggered by the weather and temperature and this causes the post nasal drip and mucus - i've spent all week researching it - what a sad life but seems no-one else can help us so, as all along, it is down to us to work it out!really great news about the lungs jim, let's be honest that was the main worry for all of us whether there was any permanent damage - really happy for you, that deserves cracking open a bottle or two!glad steph and gary are still improving and the congestion is easing - after all this time it doesn't seem to matter how long it takes so long as still improving.my gp told me i am next group for vaccine 16-64 with underlying health issues (not sure how i felt being in this group!!) - i rang and asked because of the damage to my right lung diagnosed back in april but tbf he said you are already in that group as we had looked at letters from your respiratory consultant - maybe they are not as useless as i thought! my other half had his today he is 64 - no achy arm and no side effects - he had the oxford one which seems to be what most of us will get.take care everyone and let's hope the snow and freezing weather is heading back to siberia where it belongs!lx",
          "hi lulu,sounds like you've been busy.i'm glad the antihistamine is working for you. back in may i was taking them but never knew if they were doing anything because of everything else i was shovelling down.keep us updated on the vaccine and how the antihistamine use goes please.jim.",
          "hi jim and everyoneyes that's great news jim, really pleased for you. i think we'll never take our health for granted againi'm glad the antihistamines are working for you lulu, it's encouraging when you find something that actually works. i'm not sure about the neilmed now, it's been really good and helped me a lot but lately i haven't noticed any difference after using it. maybe that's because my congestion has improved.hope things improve for you soon, dane, you're doing so well, home schooling and recovering from this at the same time. hopefully they'll be back at school soon when it's safe to do so.i survived the dentist too steph!! had my crown fitted ( the temporary one fell off nearly a year ago) interesting about how cutting down on milk has improved your symptoms.yes it's weird how we seem to have these allergies now, lulu, but hopefully they'll do one with all the rest of it!i agree, here's to the summer:)",
          "hi lulu,i think i will try clarityn too. i'm at my wits end with the tight chest and not being able to breathe comfortably. i'm running a zoom workshop on thursday and so worried i'm just not going to manage the talking.really wish i could get some help, this is the last of the difficult symptoms but it doesn't seem to get better and some days are a real struggle.i have cut out dairy too as well as wheat and that's helped with tummy troubles.hope everyone else is ok and having a relaxing weekend!",

          "good morning res and everyone,i am so sorry to hear your news. bronchiectasis is one of the illnesses i thought i had got before i saw the specialist. i take it the antibiotics are to help with it?great news you are having the vaccine this weekend. i wish i was.i was a member of the zoe app where people log their symptoms. prof tim spector has said there are 300,000 who have had covid and now the vaccine. he states there are no issues other than possibly feeling off for a couple of days.i saw the news yesterday and they said one in three adults had been vaccinated. that is far from right here in yorkshire.what worries me about all this is now the vaccine roll out is in full flow and things start returning to some form of normal we'll be forgotten.take care and i hope they can help you with your lungs.jim.",

(he did have numerous underlying health conditions and sepsis from a uti). ability to smell and taste things 90% gone.* 28th dec - go for a test. feeling tired and breathless - this was thankfully minor and manageable. ok when i sit in the warm. * 29th dec - positive result. i felt so so scared. i live in a with my fiance and his mum. we are all in separate rooms - isolating. never felt so alone and scared. * 30th dec to 2nd jan - every night, going to bed anxious. scared of getting worse, scared incase i have the same fate as the friend we lost. weird dreams about food and craving food! taste and smell came back over these days to about 80%. breathlessness getting better but still taking it easy and listening to my body. * 3rd jan - developed 1 patch of rash. the 'herald spot' for pityriasis rosea (confirmed by a dr)* recovering day by day. 21/01/21 - i am back at work as of a couple weeks ago. still feel like i have hayfever every now and then. managed to go for a small run last weekend (usually run 5k at least twice a week) - went better than i thought. i still have the rash and the sharp shooting pains have come back and bite every now and then. i must admit the worst experience of it all for me was the anxiety that came with it. you only hear and see negatives on the news and after my friend passing, it was really hard to think i would get off lightly. i'm still not 100% but i am hoping that as time goes by, i will gradually get back to my normal self. time will tell i guess. if anyone wants to ask me anything etc, please let me know. happy to help anyone if i can from my experience. hannah xx",

          "hi there, sure, i'll work my way through them now. around how many people were you in contact with from when you felt symptoms to when you tested positive? did any of those people contract covid ever since you did? **i was self isolating with my fiance and mother in law (who has medical conditions such as copd etc). i was mingling with them until i tested positive. my fiance (who we believe contracted covid march last year - no test taken though - luckily did not catch it. my mother in law started describing some symptoms to me, which were exactly like i had - pains etc - she took a test but was negative. she swears by tea tree oil and gargles it often. not sure if this helped her throat symptom though it did disappear. **when did you decide to schedule for a test? was there ever a period of time once you first started showing symptoms that you doubted it was covid or anything serious? **yes, absolutely. i was probably in denial because my symptoms were not the classic covid symptoms. but for my own peace of mind and my family's safety, i decided to book a test after 3rd day of not feeling right. **did you ever test negative before returning to work? if so, when did you test negative? if not when did you feel like it was the right move to return to work?** i thought i would have to test negative before returning to work (i work for the nhs) however, i was told not to take another test as people who have tested positive can test positive for up to 90 days. i returned to work after 17 days from my initial symptoms, i would like to point out though, i had no symptoms when i returned and would not have returned to work. i still feel tired on occasion, however this could be due to the stress/ anxiety of the constant worry i have experienced * *when you isolated, how isolated were you and how long were you isolated? for example: did you never leave your house or your room? **in total from being in contact with the person who had covid. we, as a family isolated totally from the world for 22 days. isolated separately in the household until my self isolation period ended. **how did you pass the time during isolation? **luckily i live on a farm, animals never stop needing care, therefore i kept myself busy in the yard. in the evenings, i binged netflix and did some diamond art which i purchased months prior but never got round to doing it)**by any chance did you have a fever or stomach pains? **no fever thankfully and no stomach pains. i had read that taking vitamins would help boost my immune system but they gave me an upset stomach after i took them so i didn't take anymore.**could your sharp pains early on be described as a feeling of sensitive skin like a sunburn-like sensation? **yes on the thinner layers i.e. back of my knee. like a prickly warm sensation. **on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is your worst sickness, 5 is your average flu, and 1 is very mild symptoms, where did your covid experience lie if you were to only consider your symptoms and neglect any of the anxiety? **i would say a 3 or a 4. simply because i had to slow down a bit doing my work on the farm due to loss of breath - this was a big knock for me. luckily i wouldn't say 'i've never felt so bad in my life' as this would be a lie. up until this time i had always believed that i had covid in november 2019 as i was completely knocked out. **what day was your worst day symptom-wise? **i honestly couldnt say, most days i just felt very anxious. the day i tested positive was probably the worst for that. other than that i'm not too sure**. ever since you mostly recovered, do you feel more paranoid of covid because of what you went through, or less paranoid because you got it and there is a less likely chance of you getting it again? **i am equally as concerned as i was prior to having the virus, as i am mindful that i may still be able to carry the virus even though i've had it. i have a vulnerable person at home and i work in an environment with vulnerable people. i am less anxious now than i was though.**i think i've answered all of them. sounds like you are writing a report? :)",
          "fortunately, i haven't known anyone too close to me that has had covid, but because of that i became curious on what the typical experience is like with covid. the news usually only gives newsworthy stories, which are generally some of the worst covid scenarios. so i decided to find a forum on this topic to try to find out what a more typical experience is like. that helps fulfill my curiosity and help me to know what to look out for if covid ever hits me or my family. just a little background on all the questions. thanks for your time and all of your thoroughly answers. now i can start writing the report."

          "hi elaine, yes i think that's wise. my daughter is a hospital pharmacist she thinks the astrazeneca vaccine is the better option for patients with allergy problems. i have burning mouth too and my tongue is always raw i don't use toothpaste anymore and yesterday i had a bad reaction to a liquorice allsort it's all just so random! like you it's now nearly a year since i went in a shop and we rely on tesco food deliveries. my daughter is getting married in august but i know now that we won't be able to go it's all so upsetting. the menopause and covid have alot to answer for wish we could turn the clock back! take care and i hope you can have the vaccine and get your life back on track but yes get more info first. best wishes, sally",

    "content": "hello, i had a very mild case of covid back in early october. about a week or so after i got better i lost about 95% of my sense of smell. my sense of taste was not affected. after a few weeks it started to come back and all seemed fine. then a couple of weeks ago just after the new year when eating a mint i noticed a very odd chemical taste. everything else tasted fine. then a little over a week ago i opened up a peanut butter jar and it smelled horrible. smelled just like that chemical taste of the mint but 100x worse. now last week many things have a faint chemical smell. i thought it might be a new detergent or something but my wife swears nothing has changed. it is faint and if i did not suffer from gad then i probably wouldn't notice it.the best i have been able to figure out is in very late december i was using some paint stripper, which seems to be very close to the chemical smell, and that somehow my nose wires got crossed. i was in a pretty well ventilated area. when i am outside i do not smell this at all. when i come back in i swear i can smell chemicals but no one else in the house can smell anything.i do not believe this to be a neurological issue as in late october i had an mri for other reasons and nothing was discovered. have any other people post covid had issues smelling and tasting chemicals or other odd tastes/smells? if so what did you do to help the issue?thanks!",

    "content": "seen as most people with symptoms don\u2019t self-isolate and super-spreaders are going to carry on regardless without a care. is there an alternative way in which covid-19 can be stopped..? the biggest problem with isolating once you have the symptoms is that it\u2019s too late; the virus has been passed on already in the several days previous when there were no symptoms. if only we knew from day 1 when people got infected rather than several days later. maybe the answer is **separation** and not isolation? i.e. separate the people who won't keep their distance/wash their hands from those who will. the former group (the pro-covid group) are probably going to get it anyway. so let them get it in a controlled way and they can separate themselves from others before they catch it. this will stop super-spreaders.what if shops, pubs, other small businesses and people were to identify themselves as \u2018pro-covid\u2019 or \u2018anti-covid\u2019. so people who have covid or who don\u2019t believe in taking precautions would be classed as \u2018pro-covid\u2019 and can shop, eat, drink at specific places (or times) as long as they wear an identifiable pro-covid marker like a lanyard so that \u2018anti-covid\u2019 people and vulnerable people who want to take precautions and wash their hands know who they are and can keep their distance. the problem is not everyone believes in exercising caution or distancing and you can\u2019t force them to. these people will probably catch it anyway so let them catch it, but rather than allowing them to be a super-spreader and passing it on unknowingly to vulnerable people in public, let them 'shop and spread' in a controlled environment. whether that be in designated areas or specific times of the day. so people who want to be safe will be safer and people who believe in freedom and want to take their chances can do so. a good example would be to use students who can isolate in halls with like-minded people - because a certain percentage of them are going to mix anyway so identify the ones who are going to mingle anyway and let them socialise in their pro-covid bubble where they can catch it at the same time. this will give them and others they come into contact with in the future greater protection from greater immunity. a certain percentage may catch it again, but what percentage is this? less than 5%? surely that\u2019s a good trade off. it will also allow others who are vulnerable or who fully intend to stick to the rules can fully separate themselves from the other spreaders. this is the only way to limit the spread! and it needn\u2019t be for a long time, just a 2 week trial. at the very least it should be piloted in one area. such as a university, where they are not interacting with others who do not have covid. even if just 1 young healthy person in a thousand were to become seriously ill from getting covid after such an experiment - they would have prevented the spread from infecting a further 3 to 4 thousand people! (because the \u2018r\u2019 value in people who don\u2019t believe in social distancing is probably over 3 or 4 compared to 0.5 or less in the ones who do.",

    "content": "i have to travel to the us to do a project for work in the third quarter of next year for a project i originally started in very late february in nyc but which was then cancelled due to covid. i have received a letter from authorities telling me i will have to have an 'mrna vaccine'.i am a 65 year old male in generally good health and live in the uk.i'm in the 5th category (according to uk organisers) to get the vaccine. they only have the pfizer one just now with 'emergency approval' and are currently vaccinating people with it. i fear by the time they get round to me - say, february / march - that i may well get the astrazeneca/oxford one. i know i will need a mrna shot to fulfil the authorities' request. (i assume this is because of the questions raised by the astrazeneca trials - which is certainly fair - most definitely for someone my age because only 12% of people my age were involved in their trial - only 4% over 70. i'm praying they just may make it - i.e., the astrazeneca/oxford vaccine - for under 55's. )in any case i will need to get an mnra vaccine - with which i'm fine with. my question - which i can't seem to get anyone to answer - at least so far - is this:if i was to get the initial astrazeneca (vector) vaccine ... could i still have an mrna one (say either pfizer or moderna)??? would it be safe to do so? or are you restricted to one kind of format once you've had it originally??? any one know how long should be between the two shots? i'm thinking about three months - as that is the minimum length that theyseem to think those who have endured covid have substantial antibodies following - or so i've read.any advice you can offer me in terms of this will be hugely appreciated. i have been pondering this for days.",

    "content": "hello,i thought id outline my experience with the virus to both vent my own frustrations and to get to know if others have been the same.i tested positive for coronavirus back at the start of october, prior to this i wasn't the healthiest person with a weight of 18.5 stone and no physical work outs, most sat between a computer and bed. i started with a fever which lasted 2 days and a small cough, i took and test and found out i had covid. the fever didnt get worse, but i did start to feel faint, and often began to have a few panic attacks when i felt i couldnt catch my breath, but i kept myself isolated away from my family. i then lost my sense of taste and smell after 3 days. all in all during having covid i was okay, other than the odd need to lie down and take some deep breaths on occasion i was doing my normal routine. 14 days later all of my symptoms where gone and i ordered a new test, this came back negative.o how i wish to be back in those days as from here it only gets worse.for the next few weeks i suffered with tiredness, shortness of breath awful chest pain, and an uncomfortable throat, not sore just not right. i used paracetamol daily, and was advice by my gp to use anti inflammatory over the counter medicine for my throat if i felt it was swollen. i used ice packs and hot water bottles on my chest which really seemed to calm me down and easy the pain. by this point we are on week 4 and my shortness of breath just seems to be getting worse, i speak to my gp as ive been having stomach problems, constipation for a few days at a time with barely any bowl movement. i was prescribed a brown inhaler and advised on some over the counter laxatives to try to help. the brown inhaler does the trick for a little while and i feel i can take deep breaths again, the laxitive seems to give me some relief, but only a bowl movement every 2 days and its often diharea. i keep on like this for a week or so before i start to feel short on breath again, my aunty allows me to use her unopened spare blue inhaler and my gp lets me go for blood tests, they also then prescribe me a blue inhaler. the blood tests show high levels of dead red blood cells in my liver function, that they arnt too concerned about, and i am sent on my way for blood tests in 2 weeks time. about a week later my chest started to sound like their was fluid in there and i had an abnormal heart beat occuring so i went to a+e, they did blood work, a scan of the chest, blood preasure and oxygen levels and told me they can seem to find anything at risk and that im 'fit and healthy to go'. that was week 8 and all of last week i felt so bad, chest aches, pains in my arm pits when i lay or move certain ways, breathless, and a weight on my chest. i phoned my gp on thursday to discuss getting a new brown inhaler as mine seemed yo not work as it used to, after discussing how i was feeling she gave me a 5 day course of steroid tablets and a x-ray to be done at my local hostpital between 9:30 nd 4:30 any week day. i take my first round of tablets and my chest feels so relieved, but the strange slow covered heart beat is still there and keeps me on edge, i have my x-ray and come home to a call from my gp about my second blood tests and the ones from a+e, they say my liver function tests are still a bit abnormal and that i have a high count of redblood cells, to which they can wait 3 momths and see of its covid after effects or organise an untralsound, i opt for the later and await the hospital to mail. i explain my heart/lung feeling to the gp and he prescribes me a 5 day course of antibiotics to take with my 5 day steroid tablets.day 1 felt good, things seemed okay, day 2 was a bit achey but once again okay and towards the night i felt like a new man. day 3 was worse, tight chest most of the day, aches and pains, shortness of breath, and my neck just started to feel so stiff and clogged. im on day 4 today and once again my chest is so heavy, my breathing feels shallow but i can take deep breaths on occassion, and i have 1 day left to pray i feel better before the course is complete. i still but far less frequently feel the odd heart beat and lung feeling, but my chest feels like a pair of hands is pushing on the top of my pecks no matter how i try to sit or lay.all in all thats my story so far, week 9 begins today, im constantly scared to sleep and not wake up, or to wake up and be in more pain or have more issues. i just want to have 1 day of normal. i cant even do the things i used to enjoy like sit at a computer and talk with friends or play games, because i just feel so closed in and tight and on edge, last night i had a mild panic attack from just sitting there for 2 hours feeling breathless.is there anyone that can relate or feels the same?my medical background is no allergies, i had asthma as a child when i was 7 or 8 but im now 28, 29 in december, and i am above typical bmi.thanks for reading",

(i haven't been tested for covid) and i don't have the other classic symptoms, but the high-pitched ringing in both ears comes and goes (as does the dizziness, balance and anxiety issues) every other day or so... i'll feel perfectly fine for a day or two, then boom, symptoms come roaring back. it's a very strange feeling, and i've never felt like this before. i am a 54 year old male with a fit body and no history of medical problems... the nervousness and mild shakiness with balance problem kept happening over and over again for 2 months and is driving me nuts! - i'm willing to bet i have a light case (possible neurological case) of covid.i also experienced difficulty swallowing my own saliva (but mostly cleared up after 2 weeks) next, i got very itchy skin with redness developing on my upper chest, neck and face. i have trouble falling asleep due to anxiety and unexplained nervousness (not from worrying about covid) and strange dreams. also waking up during one of these attacks i would have significant anxiety brain-fog and a general sense of being unwell... but then it would slowly wear off...only to return a day or two later!i've only seen one or two people online complain of tinnitus and vertigo-like symptoms, but i am beginning to read that covid-19 can attack the central nervous system and brain so these symptoms make sense... just need the doctors to get caught up... how long has it been for you now? do you feel that you are getting any better? what are your symptoms today?thanks for posting. :)",

          "thank you. that's a shame. i really want to hear your thoughts... please re-reply! ... and i hope you are doing better. :)",
          "here we go again.i\u2019m sorry to hear about your condition. difficulty swallowing sounds like it would have been scary.my symptoms today are much as they are every other day. i always seem to wake up feeling dizzy and then that tends to come and go throughout the day. the buzzing in my ears never seems bad in the mornings, but seems to get worse again every evening. i also seem to have a mild shakiness. i've definitely become more clumsy.your description is very helpful so thank you for replying. reading your response, i\u2019m beginning to piece together a few things that have happened to me over the last few weeks which i hadn't connected before. back in early march, i had a very light fever for just one night, followed by a light cough for a few days. i wasn\u2019t so ill that i needed to stay off work. it passed. however, after that i was left feeling like i had less energy than normal. a few days later, i had a very upset stomach, that came and went very quickly, i didn\u2019t really connect the two and presumed i must have eaten something. (i now suspect that might all have been covid)about four weeks ago, i first noticed the tinnitus one evening while watching tv. two days after that, i woke up, stood up and fell over with the room spinning. that was the worst vertigo attack i suffered but over the following few days, i continued to have bad vertigo that would come and go with no apparent cause. i woke up a couple of times in the night with the room absolutely spinning, unsure which direction was up or down.at the same time, i thought i\u2019d developed conjunctivitis as my eyes were red and itchy, and they had a lot of gunk in them when i woke up for several days. i spoke to a doctor a couple of days after the first vertigo attack who told me that the eye and ear problem couldn\u2019t be linked. (i now suspect they were). i started doing epley maneouvre exercises for the vertigo and that seemed to help, although i can still feel nauseous , like i\u2019m mildly car sick, at odd points throughout the day. the thing your message made me think about was that before the vertigo happened, i had started to suffer anxiety dreams, which i\u2019ve never really had before. a few nights running, i woke up in the middle of the night feeling very confused and very scared although i wasn\u2019t sure why. a couple of nights i woke up with a very strange feeling, almost like i\u2019d been suffocated, not short of breath , just pressure in my chest and this weird feeling of anxiety brain fog as you very well describe it. it almost felt like my brain was\u2019t getting enough oxygen. i actually worried i might have suffered a heart attack or stroke in my sleep. but after being awake a while, i started to feel more normal and that worry subsided. i haven\u2019t had that again though.in the following weeks, some days i can go for a long bike ride or do a whole day of gardening and feel fine, other days i go for a short walk and that leaves me feeling utterly exhausted.i also now realise that i have had unexplained pins and needles in my arms and legs that i had justified to myself - i must have been sitting weirdly, that\u2019s why i got it - when i know i haven\u2019t been sitting weirdly. i still definitely don\u2019t feel \u2018right\u2019. like you, i\u2019m a fit healthy man, with a good diet, and no underlying health conditions. so this is all very strange for me. i have suffered a small degree of anxiety in the past but triggered by situations i could pinpoint. i am mixed race (white/black african) and i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s had any bearing on any of this. do you mind me asking, are you in the uk?",
          "hi, and thank you for your detailed reply! i live in toronto canada... sounds like you've been through the ringer. i'm around eight weeks and for the past 3 or 4 days i've been feeling really good!... i hope it is actually passing this time. but i am cautious because relapse has happened before. but after 3 only days. i'm getting longer periods of wellness now... interesting to hear that you have a lot of the same neurological symptoms i do. i never had full-blown vertigo like you, but i certainly was on the pathway to it with strange dizziness and waking from dreams in anxiety and breathlessness. i can vividly remember the dream, which was scary, but maybe the breathlessness was a physical aspect manifesting as a dream to explain itself. who knows... anyway let's keep each other updated as to our progress. i'm pretty sure we have a neurological version of covid-19. but as i mentioned before, the doctors and society needs to get caught up. i bet all of our symptoms will get vindicated 6 months from now when they finally figure this thing out. as more and more cases like ours get reported.",
          "feeling very very similar after 3 months of certain covid, wife had antibody test which was positive and i was ill at the same time so know i had it.my worst symptoms at the time was low oxygen levels which left me feeling like i have never felt before, early fifties, fit and well but the dizziness, foggy mindedness and some times clogged lungs will nit leave me.sometimes it is ok, but can feel lightheaded for days, particularly bad late evening. also loud sudden noises hurt my head, really wierd, it is demoralising with no end in sight.sometimes feel heart pulpitations but may be anxious when dizziness sets in, can sometimes during bouts feel really unwell, then it passes.it is literally doing my head it"

    "content": "i live in new york on long island, which is still considered a hot spot. our state's lockdown is supposed to start easing on friday, but will probably take at least a few weeks longer for my region. i've got to make 3 visits to health care facilities next week and i'm very worried. tuesday morning i have an appointment for a yearly mammogram/ultrasound. another day (either wed or thurs, i haven't decided yet) i'm supposed to go to a lab to have blood work done for my yearly physical, which is on the 27th. and then friday i have another yearly physical at my pulmonologist's office (was diagnosed with mild asthma when i was 12, though starting to wonder if i outgrew it as i no longer take daily medication for it and my symptoms have pretty much disappeared).the thing that concerns me the most is exposure to a significant viral load. i'd read some good info not long ago that it's the viral load that does you in with this virus.. that going to the supermarket for a short time or being outside doesn't normally expose to you a great amount of the virus, but if you're in an indoor, enclosed setting for a greater period of time especially with a large group of people, you could get exposed to a huge dose of it. i know hospitals carry the threat of a great amount of exposure (my uncle is currently hospitalized for non-covid-related kidney failure and they forbid us to visit him), and i'm wondering if it's that bad for doctors' offices and medical labs.i did call the lab last week for info on precautions they're taking. they're having patients call them from their car in the parking lot and letting them know when to come up to the lab. they're also requiring them to wear masks (but not gloves, for some reason). that makes me feel a little better, but the radiology group where i'm having the mammogram done hadn't said anything when i called last month to reschedule (appt was originally on the 18th of april). i'm also wondering if i should reschedule my pulmonologist appt. like i said this is just a yearly follow-up, it's not an urgent appt.i'm just very uncomfortable about being in this type of setting three days in a row with the danger of being exposed again with this area still being a hot spot. one of the offices (primary care doctor i think) said their health care workers get tested daily, but i'm concerned about coming into contact with other patients who may be asymptomatic and could infect me. i'm 42 and no underlying chronic conditions (save for the very mild asthma which again i suspect i've outgrown) but i hear about people around my age who the media say are \"otherwise healthy\" becoming critically ill. i haven't left my house since the beginning of march when i'd seen my primary care doctor for an upper respiratory infection. i've gone outside walking my dogs in the neighborhood and exercising in my back yard, but i haven't gone shopping or anything like that...other family members have done so over the past 2 months and thankfully they haven't been sick. but again i'm concerned about the environment of the doctors' offices. any advice? should i cancel all the appts or maybe just keep 1?",

        "content": "you have to look at the statistics for people getting the virus at your age and becoming critically ill or dying even with underlying illnesses and you would be very relieved. of course the media focus on the extremely unlikely deaths, they are what sell news. where you will be going for your tests, will not be where the covid patients will be so don't worry. everyone will be wearing protective masks and will be really up on their health and safety. the exposure to significant viral load for example will be people who live with their whole families from children to grandparents and one of them gets sick, everyone in that family who catches the virus after who has been around the carrier every day because they are living next to each other will get more sick than the first. it happens to staff working around covid patients and in care homes where there are a lot of people living and/or working in close proximity. visiting somewhere for a half an hour/hour appointment where everyone will be in safety equipment keeping a safe distance is not exposure to significant viral load, even if one of the staff had it! try not to listen to all the scare stories the media gives you, look at the statistics and scientific evidence.",

          "thanks for the voice of reason, in these times it's very much appreciated! i admit i've only seen limited amounts of scientific data/evidence. and then there are the people commenting on the articles who think they're experts on the whole thing (one person said wearing masks wouldn't help protect you, someone else said that 6 ft isn't enough for social distance, that the droplets can travel 20-30 feet). i did manage to find some articles from one of my local news stations regarding the current situation. one showed a map of my county and the number of cases in each town. for mine in particular the number of cases per 1000 people is only 15.4 (which i think translates to 0.015 % of the population?).my dad is 73 and he's been out and about quite frequently the past two months. although he's got no underlying conditions, he is up there in years but he hasn't been sick at all. he did have something the end of february which he now wonders whether it was covid-19. i think i caught it from him and wasn't very sick...apart from a slight fever one morning i just had some mild symptoms - annoying cough and sinusitis. i might ask my primary care dr for an antibody test (his practice is offering them) when i get my physical in 2 weeks.anyway it does help to put it in perspective, so i want to thank you again. it doesn't help that i'm going through pms at the moment, so it's giving me some anxiety.",
          "try taking vitamin d and vitamin b complex, it helps with pms symptoms and also helps your immune system which means if you do catch anything, you can fight it off quicker. i am not sure how accurate the antibody tests are now so no matter what the result, still stay safe.",
          "thanks for the advice, i really appreciate it. i take vitamin d3 and usually take b6 supplements starting about 2 weeks before my period. b complex in general might be a better way to go, though.the other day i was reading an article by a biologist about the virus which made a lot of sense, although some of it still seemed a bit fearmongering. she said to avoid public restrooms because the virus can show up in feces, so if someone had used the stall before you and had flushed the toilet (without putting the lid down), the particles can be spread into the air and linger there for quite a while. she thinks there's a good chance you could become infected if you use that stall. what's now got me concerned is that when i get my blood work done this week, they included a urinalysis. i'm not sure how at risk i'd be for getting infected by using their tiny little bathroom to collect a sample. they require me to wear a mask anyway when i go there, though i've heard masks do little to protect you anyway.this whole thing is just crazy.........."

    "content": "hi all,had a fever 9 weeks ago which lasted 3 days, then 3 days or so of green/yellow phlegm and 4-5 weeks of white phlegm.throughout this whole time i've been fatigued and worst of all have significant trouble sleeping. when the sleep problem started around 8 weeks ago there were nights when i couldn't sleep at all.now i manage anywhere between 4-8 hours of sleep a night. the sleep is very interrupted and not very good quality. often i would take up after 1-2 hours and struggle to fall back asleep.i also seem to be suffering post viral fatigue. i can manage daily activities no problems even incorporating some exercise (bike rides etc....), but when i exert myself i sometimes get a slight sore throat and runny nose, typical post viral fatigue symptoms. it seems sleep disturbance is another post viral fatigue symptom.i did a crp test 2 weeks ago and the doctor confirmed that the infection is gone, and i'm just feeling the after effects.anyone else going the same thing or having trouble sleeping?many thanks",

        "content": "i haven\u2019t had the infection but i know people who have. and they are saying the same thing about having trouble sleeping. it\u2019s going to take some time before your body gets back on its regular sleep pattern. the virus was a major disruption to that. just take it one day at a time. that\u2019s all you really can do at this point. the virus takes a huge toll on the body so make sure you are taking care of yourself by eating healthy foods and staying hydrated and going on your bike rides. eventually you will be back to where you were before this happened. i really enjoy listening to sleep meditations while i\u2019m laying down in bed at night. i rarely make it through the entire meditation because it\u2019s so relaxing. you could try those to help you fall asleep. . some of those meditations last 8 to 10 hours but then there\u2019s ones that are for an hour. there\u2019s also nature sounds that are mixed with rain sounds. very soothing! it\u2019s probably something your brain could use after going through the illness. take care!",

        "content": "so a covid-19 cough is dry and nonproductive, so if you were coughing up green/yellow phlegm it was likely to be a chest infection not the covid -19 virus. 9 weeks ago is when all the media started giving us all the scare stories about covid so it us understandable that you started having sleeping problems 8 weeks ago. if you are not well at sleeping at night, i would say that and stress would be a more likely reason for feeling fatigue than post-viral syndrome. try doing yoga and practising breathing relaxation exercises. stop looking up health problems up on the internet it will only lead to more psychosomatic symptoms.",
        "sub_replies": [
          "phlegm production is a symptom of covid-19, although not as common as a fever or a dry cough. i just think that this is not a normal cold or flu infection, as i've never had an infection that resulted in me not feeling normal for more than 2 months. normally it goes away within a week.",
          "stress and anxiety are making a lot of people feel unwell and lack of sleep can weaken your immune system which can make viruses last longer. even if you have covid 19, all the media footage and social media reports are making people feel more stressed and this can affect your immune system too. try and avoid reading about it and watching too much tv about it because there is a lot of scare mongering, i heard a virologist say the other day that from the statistics he had seen so far of people dying or having serious complications were probably the same as a bad strain of the flu. also if you are not going outside and getting daylight on your skin, this could affect your sleep. try taking vitamin d and vitamin b complex, vitamin d helps your immune system and the b vitamins are good for your lungs as well as other health benefits. to have had the virus 9 weeks ago you would have had to have contracted it before then, which country are you from? were you travelling around that time?",
          "yes i am having a lot of stress and anxiety which isn't helping. when i'm stressed my sleep becomes even worse (fragmented 3-5 hours a night and not good quality). this is making me more tired during the day.i will try vitamin b and d. i live in the netherlands and i was in oman the week the fever started. arrived on sunday, fever started on wednesday night. it was a night flight to oman and during the day i was in amsterdam.so whatever virus i had i either picked it up in amsterdam, through the airport, or on the plane.",
          "aeroplanes are a very easy way to catch infections as the air is being recycled so you are breathing everyone else's germs in! at night, try taking an antihistamine half an hour before you go to bed to help you sleep a bit better, but avoid alcohol at the same time. try and have a bath before bed time to help you relax and if you wake up in the night and can't get back to sleep walk to the kitchen make a warm milk, then go back to bed. try not to look at your phone or tablet because the light can disturb your sleep. don't keep checking the time either, that can stress you out when you have trouble sleeping.i had post viral syndrome after glandular fever when i was a teenager, the main thing i felt was extremely tired, but even normally being a light sleeper, i could sleep very well when i had this. i would have trouble waking up if anything. i would sleep through the night and i would also need an afternoon nap when i got in from college that could be up to 2 hours! i don't know if it is different depending on the virus though. mine lasted about 6 months. are you taking any medication at the moment? certain medications can affect your sleep. also, if you drink caffeinated drinks, try not to have any after midday. avoid sugar before bedtime too. i also heard that certain nuts like walnuts and almonds are supposed to help you sleep.",
          "no alcohol sick i got sick, i also never drink coffee.last few days i've been reading a book for a few minutes before bed. doesn't seem to help that muchi need to pace myself with activities. the weekend before last i had 4 days off and i did a bit too much, going on a couple of jogs and cycling 2-3 times, as well as walking 2-3km once per day. then the next few days i was quite tired.it really didn't help having discovered me/cfs online. as soon as i found this my sleep became poorer and i feel more tired, and got more post viral symptoms.if it is indeed post viral fatigue it is a mild form. i don't think i have the energy to work 5 days a week but i can manage my daily activities including some exercise no problem. if i sleep well then i get more energy, at least it feels that way."

        "content": "update...so i did a blood test this week and found that i was extremely low in vitamin d. i used to live in australia (perth) for several years before moving to netherlands 1.5 years ago. i guess my body got accustomed to the abundant sunlight and my vitamin d levels has been slowly depleting since moving to europe.the initial fever may have been a trigger that really exposed the symptoms of the vitamin d deficiency. that's perhaps why i haven't recovered fully in over 2 months? i see vitamin d deficiency can lead to many things include fatigue, weak immune system, depression, and trouble sleeping (also could be effect of depression).could this explain the whole situation? if this is indeed the answer than it is a lot better than post having viral fatigue.",

        "content": "hi james. i am assuming you have not been tested for the virus? are you just wondering how to help prevent from getting it? ways in which you can lower your risk of getting it would be similar to the things you would do to avoid getting the flu. yes this is a stronger virus than the common flu but the number one ways to help prevent getting sick is frequent handwashing and staying away from others. ! you get this virus and any other virus like the flu from your hands touching your face because the virus will enter through your nose or mouth. it\u2019s best to stay home during this time but if you absolutely cannot, it\u2019s important to keep safe distance from other people, wear a mask. i cannot stress frequent handwashing enough! and using soap and water use good friction or rubbing when you are washing your hands because that is what will deactivate the virus. do this for at least 20 seconds. its good to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces like door knobs, light switches, countertops, etc. if you ever develop any symptoms you are concerned about, call your doctor for further instructions. and of course calling 911 for severe symptoms but i don\u2019t anticipate that if you are young and healthy. . keep in mind that the majority of people, especially young healthy people, have mild symptoms and recover well. keep up your immune system by eating very healthy. vegetables, fruits, staying hydrated will help you fight off all kinds of viruses. if you can get some exercise at home that helps too. so it\u2019s basically handwashing, social distancing, healthy eating, disinfecting , avoid touching your face, stay home as much as possible for now, you\u2019ll be ok and it really is basically just good common sense. we are here for you. take care!",

          "it is just an observation that a lot of doctors and nurses are talking about, that the majority of patients coming in hospital in different countries all around the world are obese. they are also mentioning other health issues such as diabetes, heart problems, etc but i think it would be weird to ignore the obesity thing. of course it may not be the only thing wrong or the only contributing factor, but i wasn't writing a medical paper on this, just observing a very big coincidence."
