        "content": "we thank you for your post. being isolated can be very lonely and can have a big effect on your mood. one thing to remember is to recall what has previously worked for you in the past that helped manage some of your depressive symptoms. many of those strategies you can still rely on! although they might need to be tweaked. a common challenge is that times like these can disrupt routines; people may stop the activities they use to keep well (e.g., exercise, hanging out with friends) and engage in activities that can make things worse (e.g., stop talking to friends and family altogether). it is helpful to be aware if you are engaging in activities that are making your mood worse. it might be helpful to remind yourself that you can handle what you might be going through, and that if you feel you need support, you can reach out to family, friends, colleagues or professionals. try to designate a few people you would reach out to if you feeling very lonely one day. this might increase likelihood that you reach out. also, creating a schedule with your friends and family on regular phone check-ins and video chats might be helpful. this can help you feel like you are still among your close friends, even if from a distance. remember, social distancing does not mean you should break off all contact from loved ones. being alone can lead to spending too much time thinking about the current situation, resulting in increased stress and anxiety. it can be helpful to connect with people who are a positive influence when you are feeling stressed. for extra information, please visit our website: https://www.camh.ca/covid19",

    "content": "i think for a lot of people 2020 was supposed to be the year where everything changed for the better. it was supposed to be a year filled with new experiences, momentous changes and achieving lifelong goals. for me personally, i had this notion in mind that this would be the year where all the plans i laid out would come to fruition through diligence and honing in on the infinite potential that lies within. then covid 19 happened. it was an entirely unexpected, unpredictable left turn. suddenly. all the strategies i had been working on to push my dreams into reality had to be reassessed, if not, put on the back-burner entirely. but even beyond that i knew that so many people around the world have been suffering indescribable losses far beyond my comprehension due to this pandemic. in a way this can be felt in the air around us. as i've been attempting to adjust to this new routine, there have been ups and downs. an understanding that has helped me stay positive through all of this is realizing that sometimes the medicine that we need to heal us is often bitter. i think that being in isolation is forcing a lot of people to slow down and reassess their own priorities. in my case, it helped me stop and really strengthen my intentions as well as add more details to the goals that i had been visualizing. i only now understand how important this step is in my journey. if i look back at life, i know, beyond a doubt, that the most difficult experiences in my life became the catalyst through which i grew and changed for the better. i find solace in this awareness. another mental exercise that has helped me is practicing mindfulness. just last night, i watched a lecture which said that mindfulness is not just breathing or meditating but it is the simple act of being present... entirely present. by this, it means to not focus on the future or the past but to simply soak in where you are right now. if you are eating a piece of fruit for instance, its to notice the fruits sweetness or the fact that you have a chair to sit in and a house that is warm. perhaps its noticing that the room is quiet and you have time to think. this has deepened my sense of gratitude for the incalculable blessings that exist everywhere. i've also tried to take my previous goals and create micro-goals that i am actually able to work on while in self-isolation. these are just a few thing that have helped me. i hope everyone is staying safe and truly we are all in this together.",

    "author": "guitar girl",
    "content": "hello, while i know that we all need to practice physical distancing at all times, i'm having trouble doing it perfectly. i live on a street which is tiny and cramped and has kids on it. when i walk out my door, there are my neighbours 10 feet away on their own property. i love all my neighbours. i have a kid too and our kids play together--not all day but sometimes on weekends. they ride bikes, play hockey or soccer on the street and are trying to stay 6 feet away from each other but it's not perfect. the only way to do this perfectly would be to yank my kid inside the house each time someone else comes out. i have taken my kid to the park etc. but there are always more kids at the park than on my street. plus, kids at the park are all strangers, not like the bubble of 4 families of neighbours who all know each other. they say it takes a village to raise a child and my little street is a village. i find that taking my kid to the park comes with more risks than letting them play on the street where everyone is known to them. so, i'm not a perfect physical distancer but am doing my best. but if there are other insights or advice that people have, i would like to hear it. thanks.",

        "content": "hello guitar girl, thank you for haring your experiences and concern with us here. it definitely sounds like you are doing your best to respect the recommended guidelines and you should give yourself credit for that. undoubtedly, it is hard to follow guidelines like social distancing perfectly, for the simple reason that we can only control our behaviour and not others'. i also appreciate how you were able to find a middle ground between staying at home and going to overcrowded parks by opting to let the kids play in the street. that resonates with me too as a safe option. children are born learners and can be quite innovative. when going to the park or playing in the street with other kids, they can engage is social-distanced games like soccer, rope hopping, charades, scavenger hunt, hide & seek and many others! you can even make an activity out of this where you brainstorm with the children social distanced games for them to play. most of us may not be perfect \"social distancers\", but i think we can still reduce risk by adopting the suggested recommendations like wearing masks and going to less crowded area -as you are doing already- . you can check out this website for more ideas on how to help yourself and your children during these times i would be interest myself in hearing other people's strategies on how they are going about this?",

in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - monday, 21 december 2020, 4:44 pm hi there, while wearing a mask that fits closely over your nose, cheeks and chin helps to avoid air from coming through the edges of the mask, some people may feel that it is harder to breathe. this trade-off can make it difficult for some people, making it harder for them to keep their masks on for extended periods of time. again, though we cannot comment on the safety for any commercial mask/accessories worn either underneath or in front of the mask, i do want to kindly note the following disclaimer that is mentioned on the website: the cool turtle product is intended for use with non-medical masks only. do not use for any medical purposes. for guidance on the proper use of non-medical masks, please feel free to review the non-medical masks and face covering page on the government of canada website. my apologies that we cannot give you a direct answer to your question. we hope these resources can help you make an informed decision regarding your safety. in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - tuesday, 22 december 2020, 10:01 am i understand and thank you. if i may touch on one final aspect of this please, the article you referenced states: \"masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask.\" my info on what exactly spreads the virus are \"droplets\" [so liquids] when one is speaking or sneezing. if that is accurate then i am not understanding about \"breath\" escaping issues, can you shed some light on this for me please? seems to me if breath escaping can transfer the virus then face shields would not be of much use? in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - tuesday, 22 december 2020, 11:15 am hi there, first and foremost, thank you for taking the time to do your research in order to protect yourself and/or your loved ones, and for bringing your questions here for others to learn from as well. we not only welcome you to touch on aspects of the article(s), but we encourage you to do so! with regards to droplets: naturally produced droplets from humans not only include droplets produced by sneezing and coughing, but they also include droplets produced by breathing as well! not everyone is aware of this, so i am happy that you asked this question. with regards to vents/exhalation valves: it is said that, \"masks with exhalation valves or vents are not recommended. these masks do not protect others from covid-19 or limit the spread of the virus. this is because they allow infectious respiratory droplets to spread outside the mask.\" with regards to face shields: it is said that, \"a face shield is used to protect the eyes of the person wearing it. using a face shield without a mask: won't protect you from potentially inhaling infectious respiratory droplets exhaled by others, and it won't protect others from your infectious respiratory droplets, as they can escape around the face shield\". again, we encourage you to continue asking more questions that you may have. thanks again for bringing your questions to us and we hope to hear back from you! in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - tuesday, 5 january 2021, 3:57 pm so guys, hoping you all had a great and safe holiday [mine was very quiet]. after putting a lot of thought into this and wanting to be as safe as possible i have these questions. since the virus would be in the air from an infected person in an enclosed room or car then being 6' apart should not make much difference? also, i don't think i have ever seen anyone with a mask which would be tight fitting enough to prevent air from being exchanged so maybe the gaiter might be the best mask since it should keep the air between your mouth and all the way down the neck? in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - tuesday, 5 january 2021, 4:52 pm hi, happy holidays to you as well! thank you for bringing your thought-provoking questions to us here today. wearing proper personal protective equipment (e.g., a mask, gown, face shield etc.) and maintaining physical distance (i.e., at least 6 feet) helps to reduce your risk of getting covid. as mentioned on the government of canada website, risk is higher when youre in smaller, crowded or enclosed spaces, where you may be unable to maintain a physical distance from others and practise good hygiene, such as washing your hands. if you are caring for someone with covid, it is still recommended to maintain at least 6 feet distance. please see this page for more details here. you are correct, according to public health ontario masks (including non-medical masks) should be tightly fitting in order to effectively contain the respiratory droplets of the wearer. when considering what type of non-medical mask to use, the fitting and the material of the mask are both important to consider. it says that, \"materials with higher filtration efficiency may offer additional protection\". we hope this helps provide you with additional information to help keep you and your loved ones safe. in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - wednesday, 6 january 2021, 10:03 am since the virus would be in the air in an enclosed room or car, would it make sense to get an air sanitizer \" spray\" before people enter the room and afterwards? if yes, any recommendations for sprays please? in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - wednesday, 6 january 2021, 10:06 am sorry i can't edit previous reply. to clarify i meant sprays for the air and not surfaces. in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - wednesday, 6 january 2021, 2:04 pm hi worried parent. thank you for your response. these are very important questions and concerns that many people are currently facing. thank you for bringing this to the attention of our discussion forum. that being said, we are not public health experts and therefore we are unable to provide government-approved sanitation recommendations or answers related to public health concerns. however, we would like to provide you with this link here, where you can ask public health experts your questions. if you have any mental health symptoms, such as anxiety, related to covid-19, please do not hesitate to reach out to us here. thank you! in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - thursday, 7 january 2021, 10:48 am i agree that my questions should be more accurately answered at the cdc ad there is conflicting info. for example it was mentioned here that the mask should have a \"snug\" fit all round the noise and mouth but in this article here: \"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know\" your mask should cover your face from the bridge of your nose to under your chin. \"it should be loose fitting\" but secure enough to stay in place."

          "in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - monday, 21 december 2020, 4:44 pm hi there, while wearing a mask that fits closely over your nose, cheeks and chin helps to avoid air from coming through the edges of the mask, some people may feel that it is harder to breathe. this trade-off can make it difficult for some people, making it harder for them to keep their masks on for extended periods of time. again, though we cannot comment on the safety for any commercial mask/accessories worn either underneath or in front of the mask, i do want to kindly note the following disclaimer that is mentioned on the website: the cool turtle product is intended for use with non-medical masks only. do not use for any medical purposes. for guidance on the proper use of non-medical masks, please feel free to review the non-medical masks and face covering page on the government of canada website. my apologies that we cannot give you a direct answer to your question. we hope these resources can help you make an informed decision regarding your safety. in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - tuesday, 22 december 2020, 10:01 am i understand and thank you. if i may touch on one final aspect of this please, the article you referenced states: \"masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask.\" my info on what exactly spreads the virus are \"droplets\" [so liquids] when one is speaking or sneezing. if that is accurate then i am not understanding about \"breath\" escaping issues, can you shed some light on this for me please? seems to me if breath escaping can transfer the virus then face shields would not be of much use? in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - tuesday, 22 december 2020, 11:15 am hi there, first and foremost, thank you for taking the time to do your research in order to protect yourself and/or your loved ones, and for bringing your questions here for others to learn from as well. we not only welcome you to touch on aspects of the article(s), but we encourage you to do so! with regards to droplets: naturally produced droplets from humans not only include droplets produced by sneezing and coughing, but they also include droplets produced by breathing as well! not everyone is aware of this, so i am happy that you asked this question. with regards to vents/exhalation valves: it is said that, \"masks with exhalation valves or vents are not recommended. these masks do not protect others from covid-19 or limit the spread of the virus. this is because they allow infectious respiratory droplets to spread outside the mask.\" with regards to face shields: it is said that, \"a face shield is used to protect the eyes of the person wearing it. using a face shield without a mask: won't protect you from potentially inhaling infectious respiratory droplets exhaled by others, and it won't protect others from your infectious respiratory droplets, as they can escape around the face shield\". again, we encourage you to continue asking more questions that you may have. thanks again for bringing your questions to us and we hope to hear back from you! in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by worried parent - tuesday, 5 january 2021, 3:57 pm so guys, hoping you all had a great and safe holiday [mine was very quiet]. after putting a lot of thought into this and wanting to be as safe as possible i have these questions. since the virus would be in the air from an infected person in an enclosed room or car then being 6' apart should not make much difference? also, i don't think i have ever seen anyone with a mask which would be tight fitting enough to prevent air from being exchanged so maybe the gaiter might be the best mask since it should keep the air between your mouth and all the way down the neck? in reply to worried parent re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe? by covid19 moderator - tuesday, 5 january 2021, 4:52 pm hi, happy holidays to you as well! thank you for bringing your thought-provoking questions to us here today. wearing proper personal protective equipment (e.g., a mask, gown, face shield etc.) and maintaining physical distance (i.e., at least 6 feet) helps to reduce your risk of getting covid. as mentioned on the government of canada website, risk is higher when youre in smaller, crowded or enclosed spaces, where you may be unable to maintain a physical distance from others and practise good hygiene, such as washing your hands. if you are caring for someone with covid, it is still recommended to maintain at least 6 feet distance. please see this page for more details here. you are correct, according to public health ontario masks (including non-medical masks) should be tightly fitting in order to effectively contain the respiratory droplets of the wearer. when considering what type of non-medical mask to use, the fitting and the material of the mask are both important to consider. it says that, \"materials with higher filtration efficiency may offer additional protection\". we hope this helps provide you with additional information to help keep you and your loved ones safe. in reply to covid19 moderator re: is this \"breathe easy\" mask enhancer safe?

    "content": "i am becoming more and more frustrated by the expectations the ministry of ltc, ministry of labour and resident families are putting on the ltc worker. we have been getting swabbed for testing once a week since november. staff come in on days off for no compensation now they are introducing rapid testing which will be 3 x a week yeah. our nasal passages will look like someone that has been abusing coke for years. no other sector is subjected to these invasive test routinely. i was one of the lucky staff to receive my initial vaccine but now it is day 31 with no word when next dose will come. i always was taught to follow the drug companies guidelines when taking medication so find this ambiguity very frustrating.",

        "content": "hi mustang sally, thank you for sharing your experiences with us today. it is normal to feel a bit of frustration with these new protocols, all the changes, and with the ambiguity. it sounds like those who are working with vulnerable populations have to follow more strict protocols, which can be difficult. i am happy to hear that you were one of the lucky staff members to receive your first dose of the vaccine! many people who received their first dose of the vaccine have questions about their second dose. according to the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc), the second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. however, if it is not feasible to adhere to the recommended interval, the second dose of pfizer-biontech and moderna covid-19 vaccines may be scheduled for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. if you have any specific concerns or questions about your second dose, please feel free to ask cdc directly here. thank you for being part of the frontline staff at the ltc; it clearly is not an easy task and there is a lot required from managers/staff in hopes to keep everyone safe.",
